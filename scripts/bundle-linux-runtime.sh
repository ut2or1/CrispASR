# bundle-linux-runtime.sh — make a staged Linux release directory self-contained.
#
# Two jobs, and THE ORDER IS PART OF THE CONTRACT:
#
#   1. Copy in every non-system shared library the binaries need.
#   2. Rewrite RUNPATH to `$ORIGIN` on every ELF in the directory.
#
# Both are required. Step 2 was the one originally missing: the published
# v0.8.25 artifact carried
#
#     crispasr           RUNPATH=$ORIGIN:/home/runner/work/CrispASR/.../c2pa/lib
#     crispasr-quantize  RUNPATH=/home/runner/work/CrispASR/.../c2pa/lib
#
# — a build-machine path that exists on no user's disk, and for
# `crispasr-quantize` no `$ORIGIN` at all, so it could not find the
# `libc2pa_c.so` sitting right beside it. Bundling a library the loader has no
# way to look for buys nothing, which is why this script does both.
#
# WHY RESOLVE BEFORE REWRITING. The first version did these in the opposite
# order, and that silently dropped exactly the libraries most in need of
# bundling. `ldd` resolves through the binary's own RUNPATH; erasing it first
# turns every such dependency into `=> not found`, which the copy loop then
# filtered out along with the blank lines. The HIP leg of v0.8.27 is what this
# cost: ROCm's clang links OpenMP against `libomp.so` in
# /opt/rocm-6.3.0/lib/llvm/lib, a directory reachable only via the RUNPATH this
# script had just erased, so it was never copied. (gcc's `libgomp.so.1` sits in
# the default loader path, which is why every non-HIP leg was unaffected and the
# bug stayed hidden.) Resolve first, rewrite second, and a dependency's
# discoverability no longer depends on this script's own side effects.
#
# Copied libraries are scanned at their ORIGINAL path, not at the staged copy,
# for the same reason: a `$ORIGIN`-relative RUNPATH means something different
# once the file has moved.
#
# WHY AN UNRESOLVED DEPENDENCY IS FATAL HERE. It used to be silent, and the
# script still reported how many libraries it had bundled — a green line over a
# missing one. Now anything the loader cannot find, and that is not on the
# excluded list below, stops the release. check-bundled-deps.py remains the
# authority on the finished directory (it reads DT_NEEDED rather than trusting
# ldd), but a failure there names a symptom; a failure here names the library
# the bundler could not reach.
#
# GPU runtimes are deliberately NOT bundled — libcuda/libcudart/libcublas,
# libamdhip64/librocblas and libvulkan belong to the host's driver or toolkit
# install. They are also legitimately absent from CI runners (no driver), so
# they are excluded from the fatal check as well. Pass them to
# check-bundled-deps.py with --allow so the contract is recorded rather than
# assumed.
#
# HOST TOOLKIT DIRECTORIES. Naming those runtimes one soname at a time does not
# scale: resolving the HIP closure honestly pulled in 2.2 GB of the build
# machine's ROCm install — librocsolver.so.0 alone is 1.65 GB — for a tarball
# that had been 97 MB. Every one of those files belongs to the ROCm install the
# user must already have, since libamdhip64 has never been bundled and the
# archive has always depended on finding it. So a leg may declare
#
#   CRISPASR_BUNDLE_HOST_DIRS=/opt/rocm    (colon-separated path prefixes)
#
# and anything resolving under one is host-provided: not copied, not fatal.
# Pair it with
#
#   CRISPASR_BUNDLE_EXTRA_RPATH=/opt/rocm/lib:/opt/rocm/lib/llvm/lib
#
# which is appended after $ORIGIN, so those libraries are found through the
# archive's own RUNPATH instead of relying on the user having configured
# /etc/ld.so.conf.d — which is a documented post-install step, not something the
# packages do. Strictly more robust than the $ORIGIN-only RUNPATH that shipped.
#
# Usage: scripts/bundle-linux-runtime.sh <staged-dir>
