# CrispASR — Pending work

Pending roadmap items. Each is self-contained with files, approach, and
effort estimate. Completed items have been moved to `HISTORY.md`.

**Current state (May 2026, v0.5.5):** 20 ASR + 3 TTS backends (+ Chatterbox T3 in progress), unified CLI,
OpenAI-compatible server + WebSocket streaming, shared `src/core/` library, FireRedPunc
post-processor, C-ABI + Go/Java/Ruby/JS/Python bindings, CI on 6 platforms.
All backends support `-m auto --auto-download`. Three new ggml ops
(`conv_1d_cf`, `conv_1d_dw_cf`, `conv_1d_group`). ggml bumped to 0.10.0.
Feature matrix expanded to 21 backends (README). test-all-backends.py
passes 18/18 transcribe + 51/54 feature tests (3 stream skips, no failures).

> **‼️ Tooling pin: `clang-format` MUST be v18.** CI pins it
> (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`). Homebrew's default `clang-format` and
> Xcode's bundled `clang-format` both ship v22, which silently
> re-wraps lines and breaks CI lint. Use `./tools/format.sh` (refuses
> non-v18) or the explicit path
> `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@18/bin/clang-format`. Never `clang-format`
> bare from `PATH`. See `CLAUDE.md` + `LEARNINGS.md` for the full
> lesson.

CrisperWeaver's TTS speed slider drives both. |
| **DONE** | #89 Flash-attn field migration | ~2 hours | Mechanical plumbing across 12 backends shipped → [HISTORY §84](HISTORY.md). Prereq for #86 closed. |

**Recently completed** (full write-ups in HISTORY.md): **#57 chatterbox native voice clone → §82** (six-commit sprint shipping all four upstream cond extractors — VoiceEncoder LSTM, S3Tokenizer V2, CAMPPlus, 24 kHz Matcha mel — plus a Kaiser-windowed sinc resampler and atomic 5-cond install in `chatterbox_set_voice_from_wav`'s `.wav` branch; `--voice ref_24k.wav` produces real cloned speech without any python). **#69 + #72 + #73 cap-honesty + KV/layer offload knobs → §79** (14-commit session shipping `CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_K/_V` + `KV_ON_CPU` on 14 backends, `N_GPU_LAYERS` on 10 backends, gemma4/mimo GPU-residency 2.2x / 22 % faster, plus cap-honesty cleanup on parakeet/glm-asr/qwen3/gemma4/omniasr). **vibevoice #69a follow-up → §79b** (mode-aware `tts_lm.layers.` / `lm.layers.` prefix predicate). #78 Chatterbox vocoder → §78. #11 WebSocket server → §76, #63 Feature matrix parity → §72, #59 binding parity → §73, gemma4 #49 + Docker #31 → §74, tests + KV Q8_0 + cleanup → §75. Earlier: #5→§63, #16→§55, #51→§56, #51b→§60, #53→§63, #54→§61, #55→§54, #56→§63, #60d→§64.

**Open follow-ups from §79 — we want all of these:**
- **#73 cohere long-form rerun.** flash_attn_ext is shipped on canary + cohere (commit 193a736). JFK (~11 s) numbers: canary q8_0/q4_0 -17 % under flash (win), but cohere q8_0/q4_0 is +11 % under flash vs cast-on-read on the same workload. F16 is a tie on both. Before promoting flash as cohere's recommended path, validate on a multi-minute clip — if the crossover is workload-dependent the docs need to recommend cast-on-read for short audio and flash for long. Until then PERFORMANCE.md notes flash as available-but-regresses-on-JFK for cohere.
- **#72 Linux/CUDA validation** of the gemma4_e2b / mimo_asr GPU-residency flip. Hardware-blocked from the dev host; expect even larger wins on dGPU than the 22 %–220 % observed on Apple Silicon Metal.
- **encoder-decoder #69a** (canary, cohere, kyutai-stt). Cross-attention layout has no `<prefix><N>.*` block-tagged tensors; needs bespoke per-backend predicates. Own design problem.

## 40. More Moonshine model variants

Convert + upload to HuggingFace:
- ~~`moonshine-base` (61.5M, better WER)~~ **DONE** (cstr/moonshine-base-GGUF)
- `moonshine-streaming-tiny/small/medium` — different architecture, needs new runtime
- ~~`moonshine-tiny-{ja,ar,ko,zh,vi,uk}` (multilingual)~~ **DONE** (12 repos on HF)
- ~~`moonshine-base-{ja,uk,vi,zh,ar,ko}` (multilingual)~~ **DONE** (12 repos on HF)

Converter fix: 1D tensors (norms, biases) forced to F32; conv_1d_f32 mul_mat
argument order fixed for F16 kernels.

---

## ~~41. Moonshine phoneme / IPA output~~ — **SUPERSEDED by kokoro espeak-ng phonemizer (#56)**

---

## ~~5. Reference backends for parakeet/canary/cohere~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §63](HISTORY.md)**

---

## ~~7. Native voxtral4b streaming~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §71](HISTORY.md)**

Phases 1-4 shipped (batch-encoder-at-flush, incremental encoder, fused QKV, live captions, decoder thread). First-text-token: 2674 ms → 650 ms. Phase 5 (dual-sched Metal parallelism) deferred.

---

## 9. Parakeet TDT decoder GPU

Port LSTM predictor + joint head from CPU loops to ggml graphs. LSTM
is sequential → per-step kernel launches. Encoder already 85%+ of time.

**Assessment (May 2026):** JFK 11s takes 4.39s total. Encoder dominates
(~3.7s). The LSTM predictor (2×640×640) + joint head (640→8198) run
~22 steps for JFK — the CPU loops take <0.7s. The LSTM is inherently
sequential (each step depends on prev hidden state), so GPU kernel
launch overhead would eat most of the theoretical gain. On CPU, the
tight C loops are already near-optimal for these matrix sizes.

**Verdict:** PARKED. Not worth the complexity. Would only matter for
GPU inference on very long audio (100+ tokens), where the encoder
speedup from GPU is already the dominant improvement.

**Effort:** ~150 LOC. Small gain.

---

## ~~11. WebSocket streaming server~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §76](HISTORY.md)**

---


## ~~16. Shaw RPE for granite graph~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §55](HISTORY.md)**

`GRANITE_DISABLE_ENCODER_GRAPH=1` is the unified escape hatch.

---


## 42. VibeVoice-ASR 7B

**BLOCKED:** Needs ≥16 GB RAM for conversion. Converter OOMs on 8 GB due
to Qwen2.5-7B embedding (152064 × 3584 = 2.1 GB F32).

**Fix:** Use `safe_open` per-tensor conversion. Then Q4_K → ~4 GB.

Full architecture analysis in HISTORY.md #34. C++ runtime partially
implemented (`src/vibevoice.cpp`). F16 im2col precision issue in
depthwise conv needs fixing.

---

## 43. Fun-ASR-Nano

**BLOCKED:** License unclear. Issue filed at `FunAudioLLM/Fun-ASR#99`.
No response. HF model card has no license field.

---

## ~~51. MiMo-V2.5-ASR runtime~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §56](HISTORY.md) + [§64](HISTORY.md)**

Base runtime + Q4_K + fused-QKV layout shipped. Sub-items 51a (mmap
loader → [HISTORY §62](HISTORY.md), env flag `CRISPASR_GGUF_MMAP=1`)
and 51b (step-decode KV cache reuse → [HISTORY §60](HISTORY.md))
also DONE. Only 51c (F16 step decode) is still open — blocked
behind ≥32 GB RAM for end-to-end validation.

### 51c. F16 step decode

Q4_K dequant on every matmul is the largest single cost at decode
time. F16 weights are ~2× larger but skip the dequant loop
entirely.

**Status (May 2026): code path works, validation deferred to a
larger-RAM box.**

PLAN #51a's CPU mmap loader landed (commit `9710f80`) — Metal
mmap loader landed too (same commit) — and #60a added the
`posix_madvise(WILLNEED)` readahead hint (commit `f1f4bce`).
Together these mean **no code change is needed for 51c** — just
point `crispasr` at the F16 GGUF with `CRISPASR_GGUF_MMAP=1`. We
verified the load path works (no OOM, mmap'd weights at 1.9 GB
RSS on a 16 GB box, prefill compute starts).

What we couldn't validate end-to-end on this box:

- **JFK transcript byte-equality on F16**: prefill compute
  thrashes because the 16 GB F16 working set doesn't fit in 16 GB
  RAM. Pages get evicted as compute walks layers, every
  re-access faults from the disk5 external (99% full, often
  contended by other workers). One bench attempt ran for 51 min
  with 0.1% CPU and never finished prefill.
- **Decode speedup measurement**: same root cause — needs warm
  cache, which we can't achieve.

The ceiling is **hardware, not code**: 16 GB F16 weights need
≥20 GB RAM to comfortably fit + leave headroom for activations +
KV cache + audio tokenizer. On a 32+ GB box this should "just
work" and hit the work order's ≥1× realtime target.

Files **not** touched (no code change required):
- `src/mimo_asr.cpp` — the runtime is dtype-agnostic; F16 weights
  flow through the existing `core_attn::kv_self_attn` matmul kernels
  on Metal without modification.
- `src/core/gguf_loader.cpp` — already wired (60a + #51a).

Validation deferral notes:
- Run `CRISPASR_GGUF_MMAP=1 ./build-ninja-compile/bin/crispasr --backend mimo-asr -m /path/to/mimo-asr-f16.gguf --codec-model /path/to/mimo-tokenizer-q4_k.gguf -f samples/jfk.wav` on a 32+ GB box to validate transcript + bench.
- If F16 prefill hits ≥1× realtime as predicted, ship the F16
  GGUF as the recommended quant and demote Q4_K to a memory-tight
  fallback. Until then both are shipped on `cstr/mimo-asr-GGUF`
  with Q4_K as the default.

Effort: **0 LOC** (validation only). The originally-scoped
"Effort: Small" assumed code work that turned out to be unneeded
once the mmap loader landed.

## 52. Qwen3-TTS

User-requested follow-on to the VibeVoice TTS work. Apache-2.0
collection: [Qwen/Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS),
[HF collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-tts).

- **Six repos in the collection** (all BF16 safetensors, Apache 2.0):
  - `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz` — RVQ codec, 16 codebooks × 2048,
    12.5 FPS at 24 kHz. Non-DiT lightweight architecture (8L
    encoder + 8L decoder).
  - `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-{0.6B,1.7B}-Base` — base talker LM with
    voice clone (3s reference audio).
  - `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-{0.6B,1.7B}-CustomVoice` — fine-tuned,
    fixed speakers.
  - `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign` — instruction-tuned
    (voice description → speech).
- **Architecture:** "Discrete Multi-Codebook LM" — Qwen3 backbone
  with a 16-codebook output head. No DiT; direct AR generation of
  RVQ codes. ~97ms end-to-end latency, 10 languages incl.
  en/de/zh/ja/ko/it.
- **Status (May 2026):** **base + CustomVoice + VoiceDesign 0.6B/1.7B all live** — talker forward, ICL prefill, code-predictor sampling, codec decoder, ECAPA speaker_encoder forward, codec encoder forward all DONE. ASR roundtrip word-exact across all variants. Open: only the **performance pass** below.
- **Shipped milestones** (commit references in HISTORY §57/§58 + per-model status table under #57):
  1. ✓ Talker forward (28L Qwen3 + Q/K-norm + flash-attn + F16 KV cache) — `talker_logits` cos=1.000000 (`2b85b78`).
  2. ✓ ICL prefill builder — `talker_logits_via_icl` cos=1.000000 (`b939d4f`).
  3. ✓ Code predictor with sampling — fixed silent-output trap (`9608202`, `69c135c`).
  4. ✓ TTS→ASR roundtrip on parakeet-v3.
  5. ✓ Codec decoder (Tokenizer-12Hz) — diff harness 8/8 PASS at cos≥0.999983 (`d1f47b1`, `48c6c1a`). Required a Metal `kernel_conv_transpose_1d` patch in our ggml fork (input-range tightening — see LEARNINGS, MUST RE-APPLY on every ggml bump).
  6. ✓ ECAPA speaker_encoder runtime forward — cos=0.999999 (`c0a9cb3`, `8a4c49e`, `38040b4`). C ABI: `qwen3_tts_compute_speaker_embedding(audio, n, sr)` + `qwen3_tts_set_voice_prompt[_with_text]`.
  7. ✓ Codec encoder runtime forward — diff 3 stages cos≥0.999 (`ef11c01`, `10302b4`). Closes the bake-script loop.
- **Performance pass (in progress, partial wins shipped).** Quiet-bench Q8_0 0.6B with all defaults: ~96 ms/frame (talker ~49 + cp ~45). Real-time at 12.5 fps = 80 ms/frame, so ~16 ms/frame still over budget; talker compute is the dominant remaining cost. Shipped: **`QWEN3_TTS_O15=1` is default-on** (commit `5e21e4a`) — cp graph reuse saves ~14 ms/frame on cp_pred under contention, ~2-3 ms/frame quiet, bit-identical WAV. Gated, byte-identical, kept default-OFF: `QWEN3_TTS_FUSED_QKV=1` (talker fused QKV, F16/F32 only, no clean quiet bench yet); `QWEN3_TTS_LK_BUCKET=1` (talker Lk bucketing, **net loss on M1 Metal Q8_0** — see LEARNINGS); `QWEN3_TTS_CP_STEP0_CACHE=1` (cp T=2 step-0 graph cache, ~1-3 ms/frame quiet savings, bit-identical). Investigated: Q8_0 KV cache — blocked on Metal `cont(Q8_0)` source (only F32/F16/BF16 sources supported); needs Metal kernel patch or KV layout restructure to land. Still open: F16 FUSED_QKV clean quiet-machine bench (the existing impl + bench harness needs a contention-free run to land a default-flip decision); Q4_K talker fused QKV; the larger lift of fusing 15 cp steps into one graph (needs on-device top-k sampling, ~3 ms/frame upper bound after O15 since most overhead is already gone).
- Debug knobs: `QWEN3_TTS_{BENCH,DEBUG,DUMP_DIR}` env vars; diff harness via `tools/reference_backends/qwen3_tts.py` + `crispasr-diff qwen3-tts`.
- **Reuse:** the talker is essentially Qwen3-0.6B/1.7B with a
  multi-codebook output head — `core_attn::kv_self_attn` +
  `core_ffn::swiglu` again. The codec needs new code for RVQ
  decoding; that work is shared with MiMo (#51) and overlaps in
  shape with the VibeVoice σ-VAE decoder, so a `core_audio_decoder`
  helper is worth landing alongside the runtime (see #53).

**Effort:** Large. ~1500 LOC across runtime + codec + reference
backend. The two TTS targets (Qwen3-TTS and any future expansion)
share enough that landing one substantially de-risks the other.

---

## ~~54. granite-speech-4.1 plus / nar variants~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §61](HISTORY.md)**

All three variants (`granite-4.1`, `granite-4.1-plus`, `granite-4.1-nar`) shipped bit-exact on JFK; HF GGUFs published. Open follow-up: speaker labels + word-level timestamps for the `plus` variant via chat_template (~50 LOC, template-only).

---

## ~~53. Two narrow extractions for shared TTS-codec patterns~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §63](HISTORY.md)**

`core_act::snake_beta` + `core_convt::convt1d_crop` shipped (qwen3-tts codec + SNAC both delegate).

---


## ~~55. granite-family DRY refactor~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §54](HISTORY.md)**

---


## 56. Kokoro multilingual phonemizer (espeak-ng)

Kokoro/StyleTTS2 is multilingual at the model level — the 178-symbol IPA
vocab covers en, de, fr, ru, cmn, ja and more — but until this work the
runtime always shelled out to `popen("espeak-ng -q --ipa=3 -v LANG …")`,
which (a) cost ~30–50 ms per call on the shell-quoting + fork path,
(b) needed `espeak-ng` on `$PATH`, and (c) emitted U+200D ZWJ tie
characters and newline-separated sentence chunks that the GGUF
tokenizer then has to silently absorb.

This item replaces the popen path with in-process libespeak-ng calls
behind a CMake AUTO probe, while keeping popen as a runtime fallback
so existing builds don't regress.

### Done (this session)

- `src/CMakeLists.txt`: `CRISPASR_WITH_ESPEAK_NG` cache string
  (`AUTO`/`ON`/`OFF`, default `AUTO`). AUTO probes `pkg-config
  espeak-ng` first, then a Homebrew/Linux fallback
  (`/opt/homebrew`, `/usr/local`, `/usr`). When found, defines
  `CRISPASR_HAVE_ESPEAK_NG=1` and links `libespeak-ng` via PUBLIC so
  it propagates into `crispasr` / `libcrispasr.dylib`. `ON` makes a
  missing lib a hard error; `OFF` skips the probe entirely.
- `src/kokoro.cpp`:
  1. `kokoro_phoneme_cache` — bounded LRU (1024 entries,
     mutex-protected) keyed on `lang \0 text`, lives in
     `kokoro_context`.
  2. `phonemize_espeak_lib()` — gated on `CRISPASR_HAVE_ESPEAK_NG`.
     Lazy `espeak_Initialize(AUDIO_OUTPUT_SYNCHRONOUS, …,
     espeakINITIALIZE_PHONEME_IPA | espeakINITIALIZE_DONT_EXIT)`
     behind a process-global mutex; sticky-init-failure flag so we
     don't keep retrying. `CRISPASR_ESPEAK_DATA_PATH` env var
     overrides the data dir for sandboxed apps. Voice changes are
     sticky. Loops `espeak_TextToPhonemes` until `textptr==NULL`,
     joining chunks with spaces.
  3. `phonemize_popen()` — the old shell-out, kept as a runtime
     fallback. `kokoro_synthesize` now calls `phonemize_cached()`
     which tries cache → lib → popen.
- `examples/cli/crispasr_backend_kokoro.cpp`: maps `-l/--language`
  to `cp.espeak_lang`. `auto` keeps the default (en-us) since
  espeak has no auto-detect mode.
- Smoke-tested standalone against libespeak-ng: en-us, de, fr,
  cmn, ru, ja all produce IPA. Compared lib vs popen: see
  LEARNINGS.md "Kokoro phonemizer: libespeak-ng vs popen
  divergence" for the ZWJ + sentence-join behaviour.
- Build verified: `otool -L libcrispasr.dylib` shows
  `libespeak-ng.1.dylib`; `nm libkokoro.a` has the three espeak
  symbols.
- **End-to-end synth check** (against
  `/Volumes/backups/ai/crispasr-models/kokoro-82m-f16.gguf` +
  `kokoro-voice-af_heart.gguf`):
  | lang | phonemes | duration | peak | RMS | verdict |
  |---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
  | en  | clean | 3.45 s | 11443 | 1545 | ✅ healthy |
  | de  | clean | 4.08 s |   541 |   44 | ❌ near-silence on long phrases (no German voice — see open #1) |
  | fr  | clean | 3.40 s | 12374 | 1434 | ✅ healthy |
  | ru  | clean | 3.38 s | 11375 | 1506 | ✅ healthy |
  | cmn | espeak tone numbers (`ni2χˈɑu2…`) | 3.20 s | 11731 | 1627 | ⚠️ audio plays but tones unmodelled — open #2 |
  | ja  | kanji fallback (`(en)tʃˈaɪniːz(ja)…`) | 8.38 s | 15460 | 1581 | ⚠️ partial — kana works, kanji becomes English — open #3 |

  Short German phrases ("Hallo Welt.", "Guten Morgen.") synthesize
  fine with `af_heart`; the silence collapse only triggers on longer
  out-of-distribution phoneme sequences. See LEARNINGS.md "Kokoro
  phonemizer: libespeak-ng vs popen divergence" for full results.

### Open

   ships voices only for `a/b` (en US/UK), `e` (es), `f` (fr), `h` (hi),
   `i` (it), `j` (ja), `p` (pt), `z` (zh). No `d_*` (de), no `r_*` (ru),

   **Option 1 — Closer-language voice fallback (SHIPPED 2026-05-01).**
   Measured against the long German phrase ("Guten Tag, dies ist ein
   Test des deutschen Phonemizers."):

   | voice | peak | RMS | duration | verdict |
   |---|---:|---:|---:|---|
   | `af_heart` (English) |   541 |   44 | 4.08 s | silence collapse |
   | `ff_siwis` (French)  | 20577 | 2318 | 4.22 s | healthy, French-accented |
   | `ef_dora` (Spanish)  | 15036 | 1613 | 3.35 s | healthy, Spanish-accented |

   Wired into `examples/cli/crispasr_backend_kokoro.cpp` as an
   auto-fallback. Selection table:

   | `-l` value | preferred voice | rationale |
   |---|---|---|
   | `de`, `de-*`, `de_*` | `df_victoria` (Option 2b — kikiri-tts, Apache-2.0) → `df_eva` (Option 2a — Tundragoon, Apache-2.0) → `ff_siwis` | in-distribution to dida-80b backbone first; Tundragoon as second tier; French as last resort |
   | everything else without a native pack (ru, ko, ar, …) | `ff_siwis` (French) | non-silence baseline |

   Resolution: `--voice` (explicit) → cascade above → empty (helpful
   error). Explicit `--voice` always wins. Voice GGUFs live at
   `/Volumes/backups/ai/crispasr-models/kokoro-voice-{af_heart,
   ef_dora, ff_siwis, df_eva, dm_bernd, df_victoria, dm_martin}.gguf`.

   **Option 2a — Recovered Tundragoon's German voice packs (DONE,
   SHIPPED 2026-05-01).**
   The only public German Kokoro voice pack on HF was
   `Tundragoon/Kokoro-German` (Apache-2.0) — the user account was
   deleted in early 2026 and the HF repo is 404. **Voices recovered**
   from `r1di/kokoro-fastapi-german`'s Git LFS (`api/src/voices/v1_0/
   {df_eva,dm_bernd}.pt`, sparse + LFS pull). They are
   `[512, 1, 256]` F32 (vs the 510 of official Kokoro voices —
   Tundragoon's fine-tune used a slightly larger max_phonemes; the
   GGUF voice loader reads max_phonemes from the file so this is fine).

   End-to-end synth with the **official** Kokoro-82M model on the
   long German phrase ("Guten Tag, dies ist ein Test des deutschen
   Phonemizers."):

   | voice | peak | RMS | duration | note |
   |---|---:|---:|---:|---|
   | `df_eva` (German F)  | 14716 | 1648 | 3.50 s | healthy, German speaker |
   | `dm_bernd` (German M)| 19185 | 2374 | 3.88 s | healthy, German speaker |

   Both produce non-silent, German-timbred audio with the official
   Kokoro-82M weights — **the matching Tundragoon model fine-tune
   (`kokoro-german-v1_1-de.pth`) is not required.** That model is
   *unrecovered* (only available from the deleted HF repo per
   `r1di/docker/scripts/download_model.py`), but voices alone are
   sufficient for this fallback path. Caveat: predictor + decoder
   weights are still the official English-trained Kokoro-82M's, so
   prosody is not fully native German. Better than ff_siwis (German
   speaker timbre instead of French), worse than Option 2b.

   GGUF artefacts at
   `/Volumes/backups/ai/crispasr-models/kokoro-voice-{df_eva,dm_bernd}.gguf`.
   Wired as the German auto-fallback (Option 1 table above).

   **Option 2b — Native German backbone via dida-80b (SHIPPED 2026-05-01).**

   Sources (all Apache-2.0 weights + Apache-2.0 recipe + CC0 dataset):
   - Recipe: <https://github.com/semidark/kokoro-deutsch> — clone
     locally (recurse-submodules: `StyleTTS2/` + `kokoro/`).
     `scripts/extract_voicepack.py` is the tool for fresh per-speaker
     voicepacks; we did not need to run it (kikiri-tts ships
     pre-extracted voicepacks — see below).
   - Backbone: <https://huggingface.co/dida-80b/kokoro-german-hui-multispeaker-base>
     — `first_stage.pth` + `config.json`. Stage-1 multispeaker base
     fine-tune of Kokoro-82M on HUI-Audio-Corpus-German (51 speakers,
     51 h, 10 epochs A40, mel loss 0.583 → 0.326).
   - Pre-extracted voicepacks (kikiri-tts org, dida-80b maintainer):
     <https://huggingface.co/kikiri-tts/kikiri-german-victoria> +
     <https://huggingface.co/kikiri-tts/kikiri-german-martin>. Each
     ships `voices/{victoria,martin}.pt` extracted via the kikiri
     synthetic StyleEncoder which shares lineage with the dida-80b
     base — saves us from running `extract_voicepack.py` ourselves
     (the underlying HUI corpus is gated and would require a multi-step
     LibriVox-pulling pipeline to reproduce).

   What this adds over Option 2a:
   - **Predictor + decoder are German-trained.** Solves the root
     cause behind the af_heart silence collapse on long German
     phrases — voices alone (Option 2a) only cover the speaker
     timbre, not the prosody/duration distribution.
   - StyleEncoder is German-trained → kikiri voicepacks are in-
     distribution. Pairs cleanly with the dida-80b backbone.

   Steps taken:
   1. ✓ `models/convert-kokoro-to-gguf.py` extended for the modern
      `torch.nn.utils.parametrize` WeightNorm form
      (`parametrizations.weight.original0/original1`) used by dida-80b,
      tolerated the missing `module.` DataParallel prefix on bert keys,
      and added `--config` so the official Kokoro-82M `config.json`
      can be reused (dida-80b ships only a HF-hub stub config without
      vocab; the 178-symbol IPA vocab IDs are byte-identical per
      semidark's `training/kokoro_symbols.py`).
   2. ✓ Converted to
      `/Volumes/backups/ai/crispasr-models/kokoro-de-hui-base-f16.gguf`
      (163.7 MB at F16; 459 tensors mapped, 0 skipped — same byte size
      as `kokoro-82m-f16.gguf`, confirming identical architecture).
   3. ✓ Pulled kikiri voicepacks `voices/{victoria,martin}.pt`
      (510×1×256 F32) via `huggingface_hub.hf_hub_download` and
      converted them with the existing
      `models/convert-kokoro-voice-to-gguf.py` to
      `kokoro-voice-{df_victoria,dm_martin}.gguf` (~510 KB each,
      `[510,1,256]` F32 — direct passthrough, no converter changes).
   4. ✓ C ABI: new `crispasr_kokoro_resolve_model_for_lang()` and
      `crispasr_kokoro_resolve_fallback_voice()` in `src/kokoro.h` /
      `src/kokoro.cpp`, re-exported with the `_abi` suffix from
      `src/crispasr_c_api.cpp` so the dylib (and every wrapper that
      links against it) gets them.
   5. ✓ CLI: `examples/cli/crispasr_backend_kokoro.cpp` now delegates
      to the C ABI. When `-l de*` AND the user-passed model basename
      starts with `kokoro-82m`, the backend silently swaps to a
      sibling `kokoro-de-hui-base-f16.gguf` if present, then loads
      the German fallback voice from the new cascade
      `df_victoria → df_eva → ff_siwis`.
   6. ✓ Python wrapper: `crispasr.kokoro_resolve_for_lang(model, lang)`
      returns `KokoroResolved(model_path, voice_path, voice_name,
      backbone_swapped)`; surfaced from `crispasr/__init__.py`.

   End-to-end measurements on the long German phrase
   ("Guten Tag, dies ist ein Test des deutschen Phonemizers."), each
   ASR-roundtripped through `parakeet-v3 -l de` so we measure
   intelligibility and not just envelope:

   | model + voice | peak | RMS | sec | ASR roundtrip |
   |---|---:|---:|---:|---|
   | official + df_eva (Option 2a) | 14726 | 1648 | 3.50 | "...Phonemizer." (lost trailing 's') |
   | dida-80b + df_eva             | 23477 | 1830 | 3.50 | "...Phonemetzes." (1 word boundary error) |
   | dida-80b + df_victoria        | 12052 | 1177 | 4.22 | "...Tester des Deutschen Phonemizers." (1 word boundary error) |
   | dida-80b + dm_bernd           | 18948 | 2693 | 3.88 | "...Phonemetzers." (1 word boundary error) |
   | **dida-80b + dm_martin**      | 18100 | 1546 | 3.98 | **"...Phonemizers." (perfect)** |

   All four German voices clear the gate (peak ≥ 8000, RMS ≥ 1000)
   on the dida-80b backbone, and three of four are word-perfect except
   for one minor token-boundary error each. dm_martin is byte-perfect
   round-trip; df_victoria handles "Phonemizers" correctly which df_eva
   misses. This is the "fully native German signal path" the option
   promised: predictor + decoder + StyleEncoder distribution all
   German.

   For deployable single-speaker production quality, run Stage-2
   fine-tuning on one HUI speaker (~half-day on an A40) — out of
   scope of this PLAN item; track separately if needed.

   **Option 3 — Extract a style embedding via the English-trained
   StyleEncoder (only if 2a + 2b are blocked).**
   Same recipe as Option 2a's recovery effort but starting from a
   fresh German recording (Common Voice DE, public-domain
   audiobook). `[max_phon=510, 1, 256]` style tensor through
   StyleTTS2's StyleEncoder, save as `.pt`, convert. Strictly worse
   than Option 2b because the predictor/decoder aren't German-aware;
   keep as last-resort.

   **Status:**
   1. ✓ Option 1 shipped (auto-fallback table per-language).
   2. ✓ Option 2a shipped (df_eva + dm_bernd recovered from r1di's
      Git LFS, Apache-2.0; works with both backbones).
   3. ✓ Option 2b SHIPPED (dida-80b backbone + kikiri-tts voicepacks,
      all Apache-2.0; truly native German prosody on long phrases).
      Auto-routing kicks in when both `kokoro-82m-f16.gguf` and
      `kokoro-de-hui-base-f16.gguf` sit in the same directory.
   4. Option 3 not needed.

   **Follow-ups:**
   - ✅ HF GGUF mirrors published (2026-05-01):
     [`cstr/kokoro-82m-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/kokoro-82m-GGUF),
     [`cstr/kokoro-de-hui-base-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/kokoro-de-hui-base-GGUF),
     [`cstr/kokoro-voices-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/kokoro-voices-GGUF)
     — F16 + Q8_0 backbones (Q4_K dropped — see LEARNINGS), 7 voicepacks.
   - ✅ Auto-download via `src/crispasr_model_registry.cpp` (PLAN #56).
     New `ExtraCompanion` mechanism in the registry — backends with >1
     auxiliary file (kokoro: English voice + German backbone + German
     voice) can list extras alongside the inline `companion_file`.
     `crispasr --backend kokoro -m auto -l de` now pulls all 4 files
     and auto-routes to the German backbone.
   - ✅ Wrapper TTS surface across Rust/Go/Java/JS/Ruby
     (commit `4f476c3`, 2026-05-01). Each binding gets
     `Session.{open,setVoice,setCodecPath,synthesize,close}` plus
     `kokoroResolveForLang(model, lang)` returning the same
     `KokoroResolved` shape as the Python wrapper.
   - Stage-2 fine-tune on one HUI speaker (~half-day A40) for
     deployable single-voice production quality. Out of scope here.
2. **Mandarin tone numbers.** espeak-ng outputs digit-suffixed
   tone markers (`ni2χˈɑu2`) that aren't in the kokoro-82m IPA vocab
   (178 symbols) and likely get dropped at tokenization, losing tone
   info. Investigate whether `--ipa=2` (without tone numbers) plus a
   separate tone embedding would work, or whether to switch to a
   different Mandarin G2P (e.g. `pypinyin`).
3. **Japanese kanji.** espeak-ng falls back to English pronunciation
   for kanji (e.g. 日本語 → "Chinese letter"), inserting `(en)…(ja)`
   voice-switch markers that aren't IPA. For full Japanese support,
   pre-process input with a Japanese frontend (`pyopenjtalk` /
   `mecab` + `kakasi`) to convert kanji → kana before espeak.
4. ~~**Diff harness reference backend.**~~ **DONE — phonemizer-step
   diff (May 2026).** The model-side reference dumper at
   `tools/reference_backends/kokoro.py` already covered the 16 model
   stages; the phonemizer step is now covered by a separate sibling
   tool `tools/check_kokoro_phonemizer_parity.py` that exercises the
   newly-exposed `kokoro_phonemize_text_{lib,popen}` C ABI on a fixed
   `(lang, text)` suite (en / de / fr / ru / cmn / ja / it / es / pt)
   and reports drift between the two paths. Default mode normalises
   away the documented benign U+200D ZWJ tie chars (LEARNINGS §6);
   `--strict` does byte-exact comparison. Initial run surfaces 1 real
   substantive divergence in cmn (`ni2χˈɑu2` vs `niɜχˈɑ‍u2`) — that's
   #56 #2's symptom, captured automatically now. No-model unit tests
   in `tests/test_python_session.py` cover the symbol export +
   null-args return path.
5. ~~**Optional polish.**~~ **DONE + CROSS-BINDING.**
   `kokoro_phoneme_cache_clear()` + session-scoped
   `crispasr_session_kokoro_clear_phoneme_cache()` ABI exports for
   long-running daemons that resynthesize across many speakers. Wrappers
   landed across all 7 bindings (Python `Session.clear_phoneme_cache()`,
   Rust `Session::clear_phoneme_cache()`, Dart `clearPhonemeCache()`,
   Go `Session.ClearPhonemeCache()`, Java `clearPhonemeCache()`, JS
   `Module.ttsClearPhonemeCache()`, Ruby `Session.clear_phoneme_cache()`).
   No-model unit tests cover the symbol export + null-handle return path.

### Effort

Small individually. Open items 2 + 3 are each an afternoon if we
go the pre-processing route. Open item 1 is "policy" — a one-line
fallback in the backend or a docs change. Open item 4 is ~150 LOC.
Open item 5 is ~20 LOC if asked.

## 57. Commercial-friendly TTS backend expansion

May 2026 sweep through high-traffic HF TTS models. Filter is **permissive
license + reusable architecture + reasonable effort**. Sequenced so each
phase unlocks a family of finetunes — finishing Phase 3 (Chatterbox stack)
also unlocks Phase 5's CFM solver, etc.

License triage that drives the ordering:

| ✅ Permissive (commercial OK) | ⚠️ Llama-3.2 community (commercial OK with attribution) | ❌ Non-commercial — defer |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-TTS-{Base,CustomVoice} (Apache 2.0) | Orpheus-3B family + Kartoffel_Orpheus (llama3.2) | SebastianBodza/Kartoffelbox-v0.1 (CC-BY-NC-ND) |
| ResembleAI/chatterbox base (MIT) | HumeAI/tada-3b-ml (llama3.2) | marduk-ra/F5-TTS-German (CC-BY-NC) |
| SebastianBodza/Kartoffelbox_Turbo (CC-BY-4.0, gated) | | mlx-community/fish-audio-s2-pro (Fish-Audio Research) |
| oddadmix/lahgtna-chatterbox-v0/v1 (MIT) | | amphion/Vevo1.5 (CC-BY-NC-ND) |
| openbmb/VoxCPM2 (Apache 2.0) | | mlx-community/Voxtral-4B-TTS-2603 (CC-BY-NC; upstream Mistral Apache OK) |
| FINAL-Bench/Darwin-TTS-1.7B-Cross (Apache 2.0) | | |
| AMAImedia Qwen3-1.7B-TTS-Cross-Darwin AWQ (Apache 2.0) | | |
| g-group-ai-lab/gwen-tts-0.6B (MIT) | | |
| kugelaudio/kugelaudio-0-open (MIT) | | |

License gaps to resolve before depending on a model: CosyVoice 3
(`FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512` — model card silent;
v1/v2 were Apache 2.0 but v3 not yet confirmed).

### Phase 1 — DONE

All four Phase 1 variants shipped to HF and registered as backend
aliases:

| Variant | Backend alias | HF repo | HISTORY |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-TTS-CustomVoice 0.6B | `qwen3-tts-customvoice` | [`cstr/qwen3-tts-0.6b-customvoice-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/qwen3-tts-0.6b-customvoice-GGUF) | per-model status table below |
| Qwen3-TTS-CustomVoice 1.7B | `qwen3-tts-1.7b-customvoice` | [`cstr/qwen3-tts-1.7b-customvoice-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/qwen3-tts-1.7b-customvoice-GGUF) | — |
| Qwen3-TTS-Base 1.7B | `qwen3-tts-1.7b-base` | [`cstr/qwen3-tts-1.7b-base-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/qwen3-tts-1.7b-base-GGUF) | [§57](HISTORY.md) |
| Qwen3-TTS-VoiceDesign 1.7B | `qwen3-tts-1.7b-voicedesign` | [`cstr/qwen3-tts-1.7b-voicedesign-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/qwen3-tts-1.7b-voicedesign-GGUF) | [§58](HISTORY.md) |

The CustomVoice contract surfaced from a config.json diff: a fixed
`spk_id` token (e.g. `vivian:3065`, `dylan:2878`) is prepended to the
talker prefill instead of an ECAPA forward; the speaker embedding is
just `talker.get_input_embeddings()(spk_id)`. Dialect override on the
`spk_is_dialect` table swaps `language_id` (e.g. dylan → beijing 2074).
Pending: extend `tools/reference_backends/qwen3_tts.py` so
`crispasr-diff qwen3-tts` covers the CustomVoice prefill path
(today's diff coverage is ICL/Base only).

Skipped: **havok2/Kartoffelbox-v0.1_0.65h2** (checkpoint variant of
CC-BY-NC-ND blocked Kartoffelbox-v0.1).

The Kartoffel_Orpheus DE + lex-au-orpheus-de checkpoints rolled into
Phase 2 (per-model status table).

### Phase 2 — talker pattern (qwen3_tts.cpp reuse)

Models with a Llama/Qwen-style AR talker + a small audio-token codec.
The talker forward fits directly into the `core_attn::kv_self_attn` +
`core_ffn::swiglu` pattern that #52 already uses.

- **Orpheus-3B backbone** (`canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft` —
  use `unsloth/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft` non-gated mirror in practice;
  llama3.2 license) — Llama-3.2-3B + SNAC codec. New backend
  `orpheus`. **DONE (May 2026, commit `a0982d3`)** — talker AR
  forward + SNAC C++ decode shipped end-to-end; ASR-roundtrip on
  `"Hello, my name is Tara."` returns the input verbatim through
  parakeet-v3. With Orpheus base in, Kartoffel_Orpheus + lex-au +
  the various Orpheus finetunes are checkpoint swaps. Phase 3+
  follow-ups (out of scope for slice (c)): greedy decoding loops
  (ship-default must pass `--temperature 0.6`); Llama-3 RoPE
  freq scaling unimplemented; no `repetition_penalty`; Metal
  first-load is slow (~10-15 min for 6.6 GB f16 due to kernel
  compilation, fast thereafter); non-streaming AR (sliding-window
  protocol from `orpheus_snac.py` is a follow-up).
- **g-group-ai-lab/gwen-tts-0.6B** (MIT) — likely a Qwen3-TTS-style
  talker variant; need a weight inspection before sizing. If the
  shape matches, it's a #52 registry add.
- **HumeAI/tada-3b-ml** (llama3.2) — 3B Llama backbone + custom
  codec. Talker reuse high; codec is a new component. Defer until
  Orpheus lands so the SNAC vs Hume-codec contrast informs whether
  a `core_audio_codec` helper makes sense (overlaps with #53).

### Phase 3 — Chatterbox stack (CFM solver)

This is the family-unlock phase. Building a flow-matching (CFM) ODE
solver in ggml is the gating piece; once it's in, three commercial-OK
models become checkpoint-only adds.

- **ResembleAI/chatterbox** (MIT) — full pipeline: BPE tokenizer →
  T3 (0.5B Llama AR) → S3Gen (CosyVoice-style CFM, ~12 ODE steps)
  → HiFT-GAN-style vocoder → 24 kHz PCM. Plus voice encoder for
  cloning. New backend `chatterbox`.
- **SebastianBodza/Kartoffelbox_Turbo** (CC-BY-4.0, gated) — German
  TTS. **NOT a Chatterbox checkpoint swap** — inspection (2026-05-04)
  revealed GPT-2 architecture (`tfmr.h.N`, fused `c_attn` QKV,
  LayerNorm+bias, learned `wpe` positional embeddings, standard MLP
  `c_fc`/`c_proj`). This is a Tortoise-TTS variant, not Chatterbox
  Llama T3. Needs its own runtime or a GPT-2 adapter in chatterbox.cpp.
  Re-scoped from XS to M effort. **Caveat from model card: training
  loss diverged late; paralinguistic tags likely non-functional.**
- **oddadmix/lahgtna-chatterbox-v1** (MIT) — Arabic T3 variant.
  **DONE** — same Llama architecture as base, T3 converted to GGUF,
  shares S3Gen. Published [`cstr/lahgtna-chatterbox-v1-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/lahgtna-chatterbox-v1-GGUF).

#### Phase 3 implementation status (May 2026)

Full C++ pipeline running end-to-end with real weights:

| Component | Files | Tensors | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| GGUF converter | `models/convert-chatterbox-to-gguf.py` | — | ✅ T3 1.1GB + S3Gen 574MB |
| T3 Llama AR (30L) | `src/chatterbox.{h,cpp}` | 292 | ✅ KV-cached, perceiver, character tokenizer |
| Perceiver resampler | (in chatterbox.cpp) | 12 | ✅ Cross+self attention, 32 conditioning tokens |
| Conformer encoder (6+4) | `src/chatterbox_s3gen.cpp` | ~200 | ✅ ggml graph, simplified attention (no rel-pos) |
| UNet1D denoiser (14 blocks) | (in chatterbox_s3gen.cpp) | 910 | ✅ Causal conv + BasicTransformer + CFG |
| HiFTGenerator vocoder | (in chatterbox_s3gen.cpp) | 328 | ✅ FIXED — all stages cos=1.0 vs Python; ASR "Hello world." |
| Reference backend | `tools/reference_backends/chatterbox.py` | — | ✅ Dumps 7 stages to GGUF |

ASR roundtrip validation:
- Python vocoder on Python mel → parakeet: **"Hello world."** ✅
- C++ vocoder on Python mel → parakeet: **"Hello world."** ✅ (fixed 2026-05-03)
- All ggml graph stages match Python to cos=1.000 (no source fusion)
- Deterministic waveform cosine similarity: 0.93 vs torch.istft
- GGUF weights verified matching Python to 5-6 significant figures

Bugs fixed (2026-05-03):
1. **iSTFT transposed data access** — was `data[frame*C+f]`, correct `data[f*T+frame]` (ggml ne[0]=T fast)
2. **Missing ReflectionPad1d((1,0))** at last upsample stage
3. **Ad-hoc source STFT** → proper SineGen + windowed DFT (Box-Muller + Hann + center)
4. **Nyquist term** in Hermitian iDFT missing imaginary component

GGUFs shipped (2026-05-04):
- [`cstr/chatterbox-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/chatterbox-GGUF) — T3 F16/Q8_0/Q4_K (1.1G/542M/287M) + S3Gen F16/Q8_0/Q4_K (548M/342M/237M). All quants ASR-verified "Hello world."
- [`cstr/lahgtna-chatterbox-v1-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/lahgtna-chatterbox-v1-GGUF) — Arabic T3 F16 (1.1 GB), shares S3Gen with base

Repaired GGUF refresh (2026-05-08):
- **Base Chatterbox:** regenerated `chatterbox-t3-f16-regen.gguf` because the old base T3 export lacked the real HF BPE tokenizer metadata and made C++ feed the wrong text-token sequence. The repaired F16/Q8_0/Q4_K have been uploaded to HF under canonical `chatterbox-t3-*` names.
- **Chatterbox Turbo:** regenerated `chatterbox-turbo-s3gen-f16-regen.gguf` because the active breakage was in the downstream S3Gen/vocoder companion, while `chatterbox-turbo-t3-f16.gguf` was not the artifact under repair. The repaired S3Gen F16/Q8_0/Q4_K have been uploaded to HF under canonical `chatterbox-turbo-s3gen-*` names.
- **Turbo T3 quant coverage:** `chatterbox-turbo-t3-f16.gguf` did not need regeneration, but Q8_0/Q4_K were produced from the canonical F16 in `/Volumes/backups/ai/crispasr/` and uploaded as `chatterbox-turbo-t3-q8_0.gguf` / `chatterbox-turbo-t3-q4_k.gguf` so explicit quant selection and auto-resolve have matching T3 files.
- **HF publication:** keep `-regen` locally for traceability where a file was repaired, but upload/replace under canonical filenames by stripping `-regen` so registry auto-resolve and auto-download keep using the existing names.
- Current runtime status: T3 tokenizer, conditioning, prefill, CFG, step-0 logits, forced step-1 logits, S3Gen replay, and HiFT replay are matched against Python; remaining nondeterministic mismatch is isolated to CPU `torch.multinomial` sampler parity after logits are already correct.

Remaining for production quality:
1. **C API integration** — register in crispasr_c_api.cpp, CLI adapter (`--backend chatterbox`)
2. **F0 predictor** — currently source fusion assumes F0≈0 (unvoiced); voiced speech needs F0 net
3. **Conformer relative position attention** — pos_bias_u/v + linear_pos (encoder quality)
4. **Voice cloning** — VoiceEncoder LSTM + S3Tokenizer + CAMPPlus
5. **Kartoffelbox_Turbo** — needs GPT-2 T3 runtime (see Phase 3 prose)

The CFM solver landed here is **also** the gating piece for Phase 4
CosyVoice 3 (license permitting) and partially for Fish-Speech S2
(blocked on license anyway). Ship it once, three families light up.

### Phase 4 — codec-head additions to existing audio LMs

Already-supported encoder/decoders in the tree get a TTS direction by
adding a codec head + sampling path. Cheaper than a full new backend.

- ~~**Voxtral-TTS**~~ — **BLOCKED, May 2026 license re-survey.**
  Upstream `mistralai/Voxtral-4B-TTS-2603` is **CC-BY-NC 4.0**, not
  Apache 2.0 as previously assumed. The model card states the license
  is inherited from the voice-reference training datasets (EARS,
  CML-TTS, IndicVoices-R, Arabic Natural Audio) which are themselves
  NC, so the constraint is constitutional and can't be cleansed by
  re-quantization. `TrevorJS/voxtral-tts-q4-gguf` tags itself
  Apache-2.0 but that's incorrect. Same blocker class as F5-TTS-German
  / Vevo1.5 below. Moved to deferred.
- **FINAL-Bench/Darwin-TTS-1.7B-Cross** (Apache 2.0) + AWQ
  variant `AMAImedia/Qwen3-1.7B-TTS-Cross-Darwin-NOESIS-AWQ-INT4` —
  Qwen3-1.7B talker + "Darwin" codec. The 1.7B talker is a #52
  shape bump; the AWQ INT4 path is not currently supported and
  should not block (use bf16/fp16). Codec is new — assess after
  Orpheus's SNAC integration.

### Phase 5 — new architectures (medium-large, standalone value)

- **openbmb/VoxCPM2** (Apache 2.0, 1.26k likes) — CPM-backbone TTS
  with diffusion/flow head. Entirely new arch family in the tree.
  High user demand → worth the spend after Chatterbox lands so we
  can reuse whatever flow-matching utilities the CFM solver
  produces. Estimate: comparable to VibeVoice work (~1.5k LOC).
- **kugelaudio/kugelaudio-0-open** (MIT) — multi-component pipeline,
  needs deeper config read before sizing. Defer.

### Deferred / explicitly skipped

| Model | Reason |
|---|---|
| SebastianBodza/Kartoffelbox-v0.1 + havok2 derivative | CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0 — can't ship and can't even fine-tune. Recommend Kartoffelbox_Turbo (CC-BY-4.0) as the German Chatterbox path. |
| marduk-ra/F5-TTS-German | CC-BY-NC. F5-TTS arch is a DiT — would need new ggml ops, not worth the spend on an NC model. |
| mlx-community/fish-audio-s2-pro-* | Fish-Audio Research license — commercial requires separate Fish Audio license. |
| amphion/Vevo1.5 | CC-BY-NC-ND. Also voice conversion, different I/O contract. |
| mistralai/Voxtral-4B-TTS-2603 + all derivatives (mlx-community 4-bit, TrevorJS Apache-2.0-tagged GGUF) | Upstream weights are CC-BY-NC 4.0 inherited from voice-ref training data (EARS / CML-TTS / IndicVoices-R / Arabic Natural Audio). Constitutional, not cleanable. The "use upstream Apache 2.0 weights" plan turned out to be based on a wrong assumption (May 2026 re-survey). |
| KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx, Pendrokar/xvapitch_nvidia | ONNX-only, niche, no clear demand. |
| NeuralAudioAI/NA_base, tokenaii/horus | Insufficient public info — re-evaluate if asked. |
| FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-* + ayousanz/cosy-voice3-onnx | License unverified on v3. Earlier CosyVoice generations were Apache 2.0; needs confirmation before committing to CFM solver work for it. |

### Effort

Phase 1 is hours. Phase 2 is one new backend (Orpheus) + N
checkpoint adds. Phase 3 is the CFM solver + Chatterbox runtime —
the largest single piece, but unlocks Phase 5's VoxCPM2 partially.
Phase 4 is bolt-ons. Phase 5 is standalone large.

Sequencing rationale: do Phase 1 immediately (free coverage), then
Phase 2 because Orpheus reuses #52's talker code most directly,
then Phase 3 because CFM is the biggest force-multiplier, then
Phase 4 (codec heads) as opportunistic, then Phase 5 (VoxCPM2) once
flow-matching utilities exist.

## 58. MOSS-Audio-4B-Instruct

[`OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-Audio-4B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-Audio-4B-Instruct)
— Apache-2.0, ~4 B params, released 2026-04. First **audio-
understanding** model in the queue (not just ASR): speech, music,
environmental sounds, scene QA, time-aware ASR, multi-step
reasoning. Mandarin + English. The Instruct variant is the entry
point; the family also has 8B and Thinking (CoT) variants sharing
the same architecture.

### Architecture summary (from `config.json`)

- **Audio encoder** — 32-layer Whisper-style transformer trained
  from scratch (not a stock Whisper checkpoint). 1280 d / 20 heads,
  GELU FFN 5120 d, 128 mel bins, max 1500 source positions, sliding-
  window attention with window=100. Output rate 12.5 Hz after
  downsample (rate=8). The novel bit: **cross-layer feature taps**
  at layers 8, 16, 24 (in addition to the final 32) — these are
  carried through the adapter into the LM via DeepStack injection
  (see below).
- **DeepStack adapter** — adapter MLP (8192 d hidden) projects each
  of the 4 encoder taps into LM-embedding space (2560 d) with
  independent weights. The 4 projections are added as residuals
  into LM block inputs at indices 0, 1, 2, 3 (so the encoder's
  multi-resolution features inject continuously through the LM's
  early layers). This preserves low-level prosody / transients
  alongside high-level semantics in a way single-tap projectors
  (qwen3-asr / voxtral / granite-speech) can't.
- **Time-aware tokens** — explicit time-marker tokens are inserted
  between audio frame embeddings at fixed intervals. The LM learns
  "what happened when" natively; supports word-level + sentence-
  level timestamp ASR + time-based QA without a separate aligner.
- **LM** — 36-layer Qwen3 (hidden=2560, 32 Q / 8 KV head_dim=128,
  SwiGLU, RMSNorm, RoPE θ=1 M, max_pos=40 960, vocab=151 936,
  untied lm_head). No sliding window; full attention.

### Effort breakdown

| Component | LOC | Reuse |
|---|---:|---|
| Audio mel front-end (128-bin) | ~50 | `core_mel` |
| 32-layer Whisper-style encoder | ~150 | ~70 % from `qwen3_asr.cpp` encoder |
| Encoder sliding-window attention | ~50 | reuse pattern from `voxtral4b` |
| **DeepStack 4-tap output capture** | ~80 | **new** — needs encoder builder hooks at L8/16/24/32 |
| **DeepStack 4-projection adapter** | ~60 | **new** — 4× MLP, run once after encoder |
| **DeepStack injection into LM blocks 0–3** | ~120 | **new** — adds a fixed-shape residual at `cur` before block-N's first norm |
| Time-marker tokenization | ~100 | **new** — chat template builder + per-frame interval logic |
| Qwen3 LM body | ~50 | full reuse (`core_attn::kv_self_attn` + `core_ffn::swiglu`) |
| Greedy / sampler decode | ~80 | `core_bpe::tokenize_with_specials` + step builder pattern from `mimo_asr.cpp` |
| Converter (HF → GGUF) | ~250 | `models/convert-mimo-asr-to-gguf.py` template |
| Diff harness reference + 6 stages | ~200 | `tools/reference_backends/mimo_asr.py` template |
| Backend wrapper for main CLI | ~120 | `crispasr_backend_mimo_asr.cpp` template |
| **Total** | ~**1200–1500 LOC** | comparable to PLAN #51 |

Headline new helper: a **DeepStack injection block** (probably
`core_deepstack::inject(ctx, cur, projector_w, projector_b,
encoder_tap)`) that's reusable for any future model adopting this
pattern. The 4 projection heads are independent matmul + bias adds
applied to the captured encoder taps; injection is a residual add
at the input of LM blocks 0..3.

### What we'd need to dump from the Python ref

Stage taps for the diff harness:
- `mel_in` `[T_mel, 128]`
- `enc_l8` / `enc_l16` / `enc_l24` / `enc_l32` `[T_enc, 1280]`
  (the four DeepStack taps)
- `adapter_proj_{0,1,2,3}` `[T_enc, 2560]` (post-projection)
- `lm_inputs_embeds` `[T_total, 2560]` (pre-block-0)
- `lm_block_3_in` `[T_total, 2560]` (after the last DeepStack
  injection — this is where a multi-tap bug would show up)
- `lm_last_hidden` + `lm_logits_step0` (standard tail)

Six-to-eight stages, similar to mimo-asr's prefill captures.

### Risks / open questions

1. **DeepStack injection point semantics** — does the projection
   replace the LM block's input or get added as a residual? Need
   to read `processing_moss_audio.py` + the model's `forward()` to
   confirm. If it's a *replace* (not residual), the injection
   builder is simpler but the math is more sensitive.
2. **Time-marker token vocab** — are these dedicated special tokens
   in the Qwen3 BPE, or are they synthesized in the embedding
   space? The vocab=151 936 has slots beyond Qwen3's 151 643 BPE +
   30 special — likely the extra ~263 are time markers.
3. **Sliding-window encoder attention with mask=100** — already a
   pattern (`voxtral4b`), but interacts non-trivially with the
   12.5 Hz downsample. Confirm causal vs bidirectional via Python
   ref hook.
4. **Family extensibility** — 8B variant has the same architecture
   per the README, just bigger LM hidden + layer count. If we
   parameterize by config, all four (4B/8B × Instruct/Thinking)
   share one runtime. Worth doing up front.

### Why "audio understanding, not just ASR" matters here

The 24 ASR-style backends in CrispASR all map audio → text
transcription. None handle "describe the music in this clip", "is
the speaker happy", "summarise this 10-minute meeting", or
"transcribe with word-level timestamps". MOSS-Audio is the first
candidate that covers that ground with an open license (Apache-2.0)
and a reasonable size (4 B → ~2.5 GB Q4_K). Adding it expands
CrispASR's surface meaningfully — analogous to how qwen3-tts
expanded scope to TTS.

### Sequencing

Don't start until:
- mimo-asr perf follow-ups (51a/b/c) are at least scoped — they'll
  inform DeepStack's KV-reuse strategy.
- Orpheus / Qwen3-TTS-1.7B (PLAN #57 phases 1–2) finish — those are
  active sessions and the parallel-worker contention is high.

Probable kickoff: mid-to-late May 2026 if the queue clears.

### Optimizations (cross-cutting, from survey + CrispEmbed comparison)

| # | Optimization | Applies to | Expected gain | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| O1 | `ggml_soft_max_ext` fusion | wav2vec2, canary, fastconformer | -10% wav2vec2 | **DONE** |
| O11 | wav2vec2 CNN → ggml | wav2vec2 family | **10.8x** | **DONE** |
| O9/#44 | FireRed ggml Q4_K decoder | firered-asr | **6.3x** | **DONE** |
| O10 | Sliding window attention | voxtral4b | Already implemented | **DONE** |

| O14 | `--tts-steps` configurable DPM steps | vibevoice TTS | **-31% diffusion** | **DONE** |
| O15 | Remove redundant neg base LM | vibevoice TTS | Eliminated 60 LOC of wasted compute | **DONE** |

**From COMPARISON.md (llama.cpp patterns):**
- `ggml_soft_max_ext` with baked scale (O1) — already in llama.cpp, saves one `ggml_scale` op per attention layer
- Chunked window attention (O10) — llama.cpp uses for Gemma4A Conformer
- Conv2d subsampling via ggml ops — llama.cpp does this for Qwen3-ASR encoder

**From CrispEmbed (shared core patterns):**
- Fused QKV (O2) — CrispEmbed pre-merges Q/K/V weights at init, one matmul instead of 3
- SentencePiece Viterbi DP tokenizer — CrispEmbed has proper optimal tokenization
- Lazy graph allocation (`no_alloc=true` + scheduler) — reduces memory churn

**From LEARNINGS.md (FireRed decoder triage):**
- Small per-step ggml graphs are SLOWER than CPU loops (scheduling overhead)
- BUT: native Q4_K matmuls via ggml are 9.3x faster than F32 OpenMP (lesson: never dequant)

### Audio format support

- `.m4a`, `.mp4`, `.webm` crash with upstream ffmpeg integration — needs fix or robust fallback
- `.aiff`, `.wma`, raw PCM not supported without pre-conversion
- Consider bundling a lightweight M4A/AAC decoder or improving the ffmpeg path
- Only move LARGE, REUSED matmuls onto ggml/GPU
- Persistent subgraphs per decode step > one-off graphs

### Other

- **OmniASR-LLM beam search** — beam=2+ with N hypothesis KV caches
- ~~**TTS module** — VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B text-to-speech~~ **DONE** — perfect ASR round-trip on all test cases. 17 bugs found via stage-by-stage diff. Uses DPM-Solver++, dual KV CFG, voice prompts, EOS classifier, text/speech interleaving.
- ~~**ggml_conv_1d_dw F16 im2col fix**~~ **DONE** — solved via `ggml_conv_1d_dw_cf` (direct F32, no im2col)

## Publish language wrappers to package registries

Today the Rust, Dart, and Python wrappers all live in this repo and (for
Python) require a `pip install -e .` from a clone. Move all three onto
their language-native registries so users can install with one command.

**Status (2026-04-25):** All three wrappers now have publishable
metadata + dry-runs pass. The CI workflow `release-wrappers.yml` is
wired up but cannot run until the **one-time registry setup** below
is complete.

| Wrapper | Pre-flight | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Python `crispasr` 0.5.4 | sdist + wheel build clean | PyPI trusted-publisher must be configured |
| Dart `crispasr` 0.5.4 | `dart pub publish --dry-run` passes (warnings only) | pub.dev automated publishing must be configured |
| Rust `crispasr-sys` 0.5.4 | `cargo publish --dry-run` clean (5.9 KiB) | needs `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` repo secret |
| Rust `crispasr` 0.5.4 | publish-order dependent on `crispasr-sys` | same |

### One-time registry setup (must happen before first tag)

1. **PyPI** — go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/ and add
   a "pending publisher": owner `CrispStrobe`, repo `CrispASR`,
   workflow `release-wrappers.yml`, environment `pypi`. Then push any
   `v*` tag.
2. **crates.io** — generate a token at https://crates.io/me, add it
   as the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret on the GitHub repo.
3. **pub.dev** — go to https://pub.dev/packages/crispasr/admin (after
   first manual publish or claim) → enable automated publishing → set
   tag pattern `v{{version}}`. Alternatively for the first publish,
   run `dart pub publish` locally with the package owner's credentials.

### Pattern (matches crispasr approach)

All three wrappers are thin FFI/ctypes shims over the C ABI in
`src/crispasr_c_api.cpp`. They do **not** bundle the native library — the
user must have `libcrispasr.{so,dylib,dll}` installed (Homebrew, apt, or
built from source). This keeps the wheels/crates/pub packages tiny and
avoids a per-platform build matrix on every release.

| Wrapper | Registry | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | PyPI | Low | Add `python/pyproject.toml`; pure-Python wheel; `_helpers.c` builds at install if a C toolchain is present, else falls back to ctypes-only path |
| Rust   | crates.io | Low | `crispasr-sys` then `crispasr` (two `cargo publish` calls); already has `Cargo.toml` |
| Dart   | pub.dev | Low | `flutter pub publish --dry-run` then `flutter pub publish`; already has `pubspec.yaml` |

### Library discovery (Python)

Update `_find_lib()` in `python/crispasr/_binding.py` to probe, in order:
1. `$CRISPASR_LIB_PATH` env var (explicit override)
2. `sys.prefix/lib/` (system or virtualenv install)
3. Standard Homebrew/Linux paths (`/opt/homebrew/lib`, `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/lib`)
4. Existing repo-relative fallbacks (for `pip install -e .` from a clone)

If none found, raise `RuntimeError` with a helpful message linking to
install docs (the same pattern Tesseract / faster-whisper use).

### Release automation

Add a tag-triggered workflow `.github/workflows/release-wrappers.yml`
that, on `v*` tags, runs in parallel:
- `python -m build && twine upload` (PyPI, OIDC trusted-publishing — no API token)
- `cargo publish -p crispasr-sys && cargo publish -p crispasr` (crates.io, `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret)
- `dart pub publish --force` (pub.dev, OIDC publishing)

Trigger only on tag push, not on every commit. Version bumps stay
manual — bump `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml` / `pubspec.yaml` together
in the same commit that creates the tag.

### Future: bundled wheels for Python

After the pure-Python release is out, add a follow-up release pipeline
using `cibuildwheel` to produce manylinux2014 + macOS arm64/x64 +
Windows wheels with `libcrispasr.*` bundled inside via `auditwheel` /
`delocate` / `delvewheel`. Same for Rust if we ever want
`crispasr-sys` to vendor the native build like `tch-rs` /
`onnxruntime-sys` do. Defer until pure-Python wheel is out and stable.

## 59. Cross-binding C-ABI parity

The Session API surface for TTS (incl. qwen3-tts Base / CustomVoice /
VoiceDesign variant routing) is fully wrapped across all 7 bindings as
of commit `65e0a61` + the Dart follow-up. **The non-Session ABI (~80
exports) is still C-ABI-only or partially-wrapped on most bindings.**
This entry tracks closing those gaps.

### Coverage matrix (May 2026)

C-ABI exposes 127+ unique `crispasr_*` exports in
`src/crispasr_c_api.cpp`. Coverage by binding:

| Binding | Symbols wrapped | Approx % | ASR Transcribe | TTS Session | Variant detect | Align | Diarize | LID | VAD | Streaming | Punc | Registry | Cache |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rust (`crispasr-sys`) | 56 | ~44% | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Python (`_binding.py`) | 53 | ~42% | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dart (`flutter/crispasr`) | ~30 | ~24% | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Go (`bindings/go`) | ~45 | ~35% | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Java (JNA) | ~38 | ~30% | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅¹ | ✅¹ | ✅¹ |
| Ruby (C ext) | ~30 | ~24% | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅¹ | ❌ | ❌ |
| JS (emscripten) | 18 | ~14% | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

¹ JNA declarations added, idiomatic Java wrapper methods pending.

Rust + Python are the canonical / "full-coverage" wrappers. The other
five track the high-traffic surface (transcribe + TTS) and were swept
together in `4f476c3` (set_speaker_name) and `65e0a61` (set_instruct +
variant detect).

### Capabilities reachable only from C-ABI / Rust / Python

For each, ~3-12 exports + an idiomatic result type per binding:

- **Forced alignment** — `crispasr_align_words`, `align_words_abi`,
  `align_result_*`. Word-level timestamps from a transcript + audio.
- **Diarization** — `crispasr_diarize_segments[_abi]`. Speaker segment
  spans.
- **Language ID** — `crispasr_detect_language[_pcm]`,
  `crispasr_lid_free_cache`. Pre-transcribe LID for routing.
- **VAD** — `crispasr_vad_segments`, `crispasr_compute_vad_slices`,
  `crispasr_stitch_vad_slices`, `crispasr_vad_remap_timestamp`,
  `crispasr_vad_free`. Standalone VAD + slice stitching.
- **Streaming** — `crispasr_stream_open/feed/get_text/flush/close`,
  `crispasr_stream_run_decode`. Online ASR with a step buffer.
- **Punctuation** — `crispasr_punc_init/process/free/free_text`.
  FireRedPunc post-processor.
- **Model registry** — `crispasr_registry_lookup[_abi]`,
  `registry_lookup_by_filename[_abi]`,
  `crispasr_detect_backend_from_gguf`. Backend / file resolution.
- **Cache** — `crispasr_cache_dir_abi`,
  `crispasr_cache_ensure_file_abi`. Auto-download dir + lookup.

### Effort

Per binding ~150-300 LOC (extern decls + idiomatic methods + result
types + smoke test). Five trailing bindings × 9 capability surfaces ×
~30 LOC each ≈ 1.5 kLOC total. Each capability is independent — can
be staged.

Suggested ordering once a consumer asks:
1. Streaming (Go/Java first — common deployment shapes for ASR servers).
2. VAD + alignment (mobile use cases via Dart).
3. Diarization + LID + punctuation (transcription pipelines).
4. Registry + cache (CLI-style consumers).

### When to do this

Not now. The qwen3-tts sweep was justified because PLAN #57 Phase 2
unblocks needed it. Open this section when a concrete consumer shows
up asking for, say, "Java VAD" or "Go streaming". Reference commits
for the pattern: `4f476c3` (TTS surface sweep) and `65e0a61`
(variant detection sweep). Same shape applies to every other capability.

## ~~60. Cross-backend perf tricks (llama.cpp / llamafile ports)~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §63, §64, §71, §75](HISTORY.md)**

60a-g shipped (madvise WILLNEED, wrap_iface, preload, fused QKV, KV Q8_0 on 9 backends, mlock, MADV_RANDOM). 60h-n parked/skip. 60o (MTLBinaryArchive pipeline cache) remains OPEN — see below.

### 60o (OPEN). MTLBinaryArchive Metal pipeline cache

**Status:** OPEN. **Tier 1.** **Effort:** M (~half day source patch
in upstream `ggml/src/ggml-metal/`). **Source:** raised by CrisperWeaver
PLAN §5.18 — the highest-leverage perf item the Flutter app's CI
sweep is currently waiting on.

**Problem.** ggml-metal compiles MSL pipelines lazily for each unique
tensor shape on first use, then caches them in-memory only. Every
fresh process pays 30–60 s of MTLLibrary + MTLComputePipelineState
JIT before the first `ggml_metal_encode` lands. Affects:

* Every `flutter test` / `crispasr` CLI invocation on the dev box
  (~30–60 s startup tax per run).
* Every CI sweep — measured at ~25 min for the single-process
  multi-backend pass; projected ~5 min if pipelines were warm.
* Every end-user app launch on macOS / iOS / iPadOS where pipelines
  are recompiled across the whole loaded model on first transcribe.

**Fix.** Use Apple's first-party `MTLBinaryArchive` API to write
freshly-compiled pipeline state objects to a per-device disk cache
on shutdown and reload them on startup. Same pattern Apple's own
MPS / MLX use. Sketch:

* Patch `ggml/src/ggml-metal/ggml-metal-device.m`:
  - On `ggml_metal_device_init`, attempt
    `[device newBinaryArchiveWithDescriptor:]` from
    `${GGML_METAL_PIPELINE_CACHE}` (default
    `~/Library/Caches/ggml-metal/<device-name>.archive`).
  - When `ggml_metal_compile_pipeline` produces a new
    `id<MTLComputePipelineState>`, also call
    `[archive addComputePipelineFunctionsWithDescriptor:]` so the
    next process can rehydrate it.
  - On exit (or via an explicit `ggml_metal_pipeline_cache_save`),
    `[archive serializeToURL:]` flushes to disk.
* Joins the existing `// CrispASR patch` set in ggml-metal — same
  rebase discipline as the conv_transpose_1d perf patch.
* Cache invalidation: include device name + ggml-metal source
  hash in the archive path so a kernel change auto-busts the cache.

**Risk.** Low — Apple's API is stable since iOS 14 / macOS 11. Worst
case the archive fails to load and we fall back to the existing JIT
path, exactly today's behaviour.

**Why Tier 1.** The 30–60 s saved compounds across every consumer
of CrispASR (CLI, CrisperWeaver, the wrapper bindings, CI). Same
order-of-magnitude impact as 60a (madvise WILLNEED) had on cold-mmap
weight loads.

---

## ~~65. Session-API word-confidence parity~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §65](HISTORY.md)**

Main batch + 65a (vibevoice / moonshine-streaming) + 65a-residue
(gemma4-e2b token-prob API) all landed. Go/Java/Ruby brought to
parity in `5534588` + `d963e3a`. **Only residual:** JS / emscripten
word-accessor surface — leaving until a JS consumer asks (the
current JS binding is TTS-focused).

---

## 61. Feature matrix uplift

The README "Feature matrix" was missing checkmarks for many cells
where the underlying model already supported the feature. Tracker
for closing the remaining gaps.

### 61a-f — **DONE → [HISTORY §65](HISTORY.md)**

| Sub-item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| 61a Auto-download for fc-ctc + wav2vec2 | 2 ✔ |
| 61b Per-token confidence × 7 backends | 7 ✔ (full row, 15/15) |
| 61c Kyutai native + word timestamps | 2 ✔ |
| 61d Best-of-N × 4 LLM-style decoders | 4 ✔ |
| 61e Temperature for omniasr-llm | 1 ✔ |
| 61f Punctuation toggle × 4 LLM-style decoders | 4 ✔ |
| **Subtotal** | **20 cells gained** |

### 61g. Audio Q&A (`--ask`) — DEFERRED

glm-asr is an ASR fine-tune (hardcoded prompt ids, no live
tokenizer for arbitrary instructions); omniasr-llm uses FLORES-200
language conditioning, not chat. Both would need empirical
validation showing the model honours an instruction prompt before
plumbing the toggle. Out of scope until a backend lands that's
actually instruction-tuned.

### 61h. Beam search for LLM family + enc-dec — IN PROGRESS

**Tier:** 3. **Effort:** ~300 LOC for shared decoder + 30 LOC per
backend. **Cells:** 8 (LLM quartet + qwen3/granite/voxtral4b +
canary/cohere/moonshine via per-model loop).

| Sub-step | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Generic `core_beam_decode` helper (header-only) — replay-from-prefix variant | DONE → [HISTORY §65](HISTORY.md) |
| Branched-KV variant (`run_with_probs_branched`) — per-beam `save`/`restore`/`step` callbacks | DONE — `O(B × T)` single-token forwards |
| glm-asr beam path (`-bs N`) | DONE — 1 ✔ (replay-from-prefix; batched LM helper) |
| moonshine LLM-side beam | DONE — 1 ✔ (branched-KV; per-layer `kv_self.{k,v}` snapshot) |
| omniasr-llm beam | DONE — 1 ✔ (branched-KV; whole-tensor `kv_k` / `kv_v` snapshot) |
| kyutai-stt per-frame text-token beam | DONE — 1 ✔ (branched-KV; one pick per Mimi frame, audio codes shared across beams) |
| qwen3/granite/voxtral4b/voxtral session-API beam | DEFERRED — pure plumbing once the session API exposes `beam_size` |
| canary/cohere/moonshine encoder-decoder beam (per-decoder loop) | DEFERRED — separate scope from the LLM beam path |

**What landed (May 2026 follow-up).** The original entry deferred
omniasr-llm / kyutai-stt / moonshine because `replay_fn` does
`O(B × T²)` single-token forwards for backends with one-token-at-a-
time decode. Resolved by adding `core_beam_decode::run_with_probs_branched`
— takes per-beam KV `save_fn`/`restore_fn`/`snap_free_fn`/`step_fn`
callbacks. Cost drops to `O(B × T)`. Snap holders are refcounted via
`shared_ptr` inside the helper so siblings can share a parent's snap
without double-free.

For each backend, KV snapshots are full-tensor `ggml_backend_tensor_get`
on either per-layer (`moonshine`) or contiguous (`omniasr-llm`,
`kyutai-stt`) K/V tensors. Cross-attention KV (moonshine, kyutai's
audio codes) stays shared across beams.

Smoke results on JFK (11 s, Metal, warm cache):

| Backend | model | `-bs 1` | `-bs 2` | `-bs 4` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| moonshine | tiny-q4_k | 0.57s | 0.57s | 0.57s (improved transcript) |
| omniasr-llm | 300m-v2-q4_k | ~9.5s pure / 38s wall | ~22s | ~42s pure / 70s wall |
| kyutai-stt | 1b-q4_k | 5.1s | 8.6s | 14.2s |

Wall scales ~linearly with beam (each beam adds ~1× greedy compute).
Transcripts match greedy at all beam sizes; moonshine's `-bs 4`
actually improved quality on JFK ("fellow Americans" vs greedy's
"fellow-american"). omniasr-llm at `-bs 4` lands above the 60s
"rough" gate but well within order-of-magnitude.

**Still deferred and why.** The session-API quartet (qwen3, granite,
voxtral4b, voxtral) and the classic encoder-decoder backends (canary,
cohere) need either session-API plumbing (just `set_beam_size`
exposure) or a per-decoder beam path that reuses the cross-attention
KV across all beams. Both are pure plumbing — reopen when the wave
of enc-dec backends has a clear quality win to point at.

### 61i. Flash attention for fc-ctc — DEFERRED

`core_conformer::build_block`'s rel-pos path (`Q·K + R·Q_v +
rel_shift`) doesn't fit `ggml_flash_attn_ext` — the kernel has no
rel-pos hook. Would need either a positional-encoding swap or a
custom flash kernel. Reopen after PLAN #58 / Conformer rewrite.

### 61j. Translate + source/target lang for voxtral4b / glm-asr / omniasr-llm — OPEN

**Tier:** 3. **Effort:** ~100 LOC + empirical validation.
**Cells:** 3-6.

Try the translate template each model honours; ASR-roundtrip a
known X→Y pair; if sensible, add `CAP_TRANSLATE | CAP_SRC_TGT_LANGUAGE`.

### 61k. Grammar (GBNF) — BLOCKED on PLAN #60k

**Tier:** 4. **Cells:** 8 (qwen3, voxtral, voxtral4b, granite,
glm-asr, moonshine, omniasr-llm, kyutai-stt).

When 60k lands, every backend that token-by-token decodes through a
sampler can constrain output. Pure plumbing per backend.

### Validation gate

Each step must pass: golden JFK transcript unchanged, the new ✔
shows up in `crispasr --list-backends`, README matrix line updated,
`warn_unsupported` no longer fires for the toggled flag.

---

## ~~62. Streaming + mic library API~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §73, §76](HISTORY.md)**

All streaming + mic sub-items shipped. Session stream API, Python/Rust/Dart/Go wrappers, miniaudio mic, kyutai-stt + moonshine chunked-batch streaming, voxtral4b native streaming (PLAN #7). Init-only flag refactor deferred.

---

## 66. Wrapper publishing bootstrap — required before language registries can ship

**Status:** OPEN, auto-trigger silenced. The `tags: ['v*']` push
trigger on `release-wrappers.yml` is now COMMENTED OUT so future tag
pushes don't keep producing red runs while we're not ready to
bootstrap. Workflow stays in the repo on `workflow_dispatch` only —
manual dispatch still works for ad-hoc testing during bootstrap.
Failed on every release since v0.5.0; confirmed again on v0.5.4
(`gh run view 25248028443`).

The CI workflow pushes to three registries automatically on every
`v*` tag, but **none of the packages currently exist on those
registries**:

- crates.io: `crispasr-sys` and `crispasr` do not exist (404).
- PyPI: `crispasr` does not exist (404).
- pub.dev: `crispasr` does not exist.

All three registries require **manual bootstrap** — the first
version of any package can't be published by an OIDC / token CI
flow because the registry has no prior owner record to verify
against. After the first manual publish, automated publishing
takes over via the existing workflow.

### Bootstrap steps (one-time, requires repo admin credentials)

1. **crates.io** (Rust, simplest):
   ```bash
   cargo login   # paste API token from https://crates.io/me
   cargo publish --manifest-path crispasr-sys/Cargo.toml --allow-dirty
   sleep 30   # wait for crates.io index
   cargo publish --manifest-path crispasr/Cargo.toml --allow-dirty
   ```
   Then add `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` repo secret (Settings → Secrets
   → Actions). Subsequent tag pushes auto-publish.

2. **PyPI** (uses trusted publishing / OIDC):
   - Visit https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/ and create a
     pending publisher with:
     - Owner: `CrispStrobe` (or org owning the repo)
     - Repository: `CrispASR`
     - Workflow: `release-wrappers.yml`
     - Environment: `pypi`
   - Push a `v*` tag and the OIDC handshake creates the package.
     (No manual `twine upload` needed — the pending-publisher
     mechanism IS the bootstrap path.)

3. **pub.dev** (Dart, hardest — `dart pub publish` requires a
   logged-in interactive shell for the first version):
   ```bash
   cd flutter/crispasr
   dart pub get
   dart pub publish   # interactive: confirm, log in via browser,
                      # accept the package contents
   ```
   Then visit https://pub.dev/packages/crispasr/admin and enable
   "Automated publishing" with:
   - Repository: `CrispStrobe/CrispASR`
   - Tag pattern: `v{{version}}`

### Resilience improvements landed alongside this entry

`release-wrappers.yml` is updated so when we DO re-enable the
auto-trigger, a single registry's misconfiguration doesn't fail the
whole workflow:

- Auto-trigger on `tags: ['v*']` is currently **commented out**.
  Re-enable by un-commenting the two lines (`push:` /
  `tags: ['v*']`) after bootstrap completes.
- Each job runs a fast secret/config presence check at the top and
  echoes a clear "skipping: registry X not configured" instead of
  letting `cargo` / `twine` emit cryptic auth errors deep in the
  log.
- Each job uses `continue-on-error: true` so the others still try.
- Workflow comment block updated to reference this PLAN section.

After bootstrap + re-enabling the trigger, the next tag push should
publish all three wrappers cleanly.

## 67. Deferred follow-ups carry-over (mid-May 2026 session)

Captured here so they don't get lost between sessions.

### 60d F16 mimo-asr re-upload (HF)

The Q4_K fused-QKV file is on HF
(`cstr/mimo-asr-GGUF/mimo-asr-q4_k.gguf`, 4.2 GB). The F16 variant
on HF is still the legacy unfused layout — the runtime fallback
keeps it working but it doesn't get the 1.7× per-step decode that
fused QKV unlocks. Re-conversion needs a fresh BF16→F16 run,
which on this 16 GB / 99%-full-disk box sustained ~0.8 MB/min and
was killed at 22 min (PLAN #51c disk-thrash signature). Run on a
32+ GB box with non-99%-full external. Then
`tools/patch_mimo_asr_fuse_qkv.py` patches it to the fused layout
(~5 min vs hours for a fresh quantize).

### 60e per-backend Q8_0 KV cosine validation

Env wiring (`CRISPASR_KV_QUANT={f16,q8_0,q4_0}`) landed across 9
backends (mimo_asr, qwen3_asr, voxtral, voxtral4b, granite_speech,
gemma4_e2b, glm_asr, omniasr, orpheus, qwen3_tts) — defaults stay
F16 so it's bit-identical until opted in. **Only mimo-asr has been
diff-harness validated at q8_0** (last_hidden 0.963031 vs F16
0.963177; logits 0.981454 vs 0.981261, both ≥0.98 gate). The
remaining 8 backends need their own
`CRISPASR_KV_QUANT=q8_0 crispasr-diff <backend>` pass before any
default-flip per backend.

Effort: ~1 diff-harness run per backend, ~5 min each on warm
cache. Zero code work — wiring is in place.

### Vibevoice CUDA cache reuse re-test

`backend_needs_fresh_pred_graph()` defensively bypasses the
pred-head graph cache on Metal + Vulkan + CUDA (CUDA added on the
"shape suggests it's broken too" presumption). When a CUDA box is
available, run `CRISPASR_VIBEVOICE_REUSE_PRED_GRAPH=1` and confirm
TTS runs without `GGML_ASSERT(src_backend_id != -1)`. If the cache
works there, drop the `CUDA` prefix from the bypass list and
recover the ~30% per-synthesis caching speedup.

If the assert fires, the env hatch stays disabled by default and
the proper upstream-ggml fix (recompute view→backend mapping
from `view_src->buffer` in `ggml_backend_sched_split_graph`)
becomes the next step.

### SYCL / HIP / ROCm cache-bypass extension

Same shape as CUDA — these multi-backend GPU schedulers probably
need the bypass too but no user has reported. Extend
`backend_needs_fresh_pred_graph()` prefix list when a report comes
in or when a kernel maintainer audits the upstream
`ggml_backend_sched_split_graph` reset path on those backends.

### Per-backend `MADV_RANDOM` post-prefill wiring (PLAN #60g)

`core_gguf::mmap_advise_random()` is exposed but no backend calls
it yet. Add a single call between prefill and the decode loop in
`mimo_asr_transcribe`, `qwen3_asr_transcribe`, `voxtral_transcribe`,
etc. when a 32+ GB-box benchmark demonstrates measurable benefit
(on Q4_K the readahead delta is marginal; F16 is where it would
matter, and we can't reliably measure F16 on 16 GB).

### Disk5 cleanup

`/Volumes/backups` sits at 99% full, 30 GB free. The
`/Volumes/backups/ai/crispasr-models/mimo/mimo-asr-q4_k.gguf`
unfused (4.2 GB) is now superseded by `mimo-asr-q4_k.fused.gguf`
and the HF copy of the fused. Safe to delete the local unfused
once future A/B testing isn't needed.

### CI: legacy `build.yml`

`.github/workflows/build.yml` is the legacy whisper.cpp CI matrix
(triggers on `branches: [master]` which doesn't exist + `tags: v*`).
Has been failing on every tag push since v0.4.x. Doesn't block
releases (the new `ci.yml` / `release.yml` are the actual gates).
Either delete or repair when convenient — pending audit on whether
any build-matrix combination there isn't covered by the new
`ci.yml` matrix.

## ~~63. Feature matrix parity~~ — **DONE → [HISTORY §72](HISTORY.md)**

All 9 phases shipped: beam search (granite + qwen3), flash-attn declarations (6 backends), auto-download (omniasr + mimo-asr), CTC timestamps (5 backends), auto-punctuation (4 CTC backends), best-of-N SDK surface, capability declaration fixes, vibevoice CLI adapter confirmed, translation investigated (not feasible for cohere/glm-asr).


## ~~69. Layer + KV CPU-offload knobs (llama.cpp parity)~~ — FUNCTIONALLY SHIPPED 2026-05-04 → [HISTORY §79](HISTORY.md)

#69b (KV-on-CPU) and #69e (asymmetric K/V quant) shipped on **14 backends**. #69a (layer offload) shipped on **10 backends** (vibevoice closed via §79b — mode-aware prefix predicate). Three knobs stack — see §79 for the combined-config example.

Original detailed write-up retained below for reference:



**Effort:** Medium-large per backend (~150-200 LOC for the
weight-residency-aware variant — see scope note below). Originally
estimated at 50-80 LOC; that turned out to be the *compute-only*
pattern, which doesn't actually solve the VRAM-pressure problem
this PLAN entry exists for.

**Two valid designs, only one is useful for #60's case.**

**(a) Compute-only offload** (~50 LOC, kokoro / vibevoice pattern).
Walk the built graph, call
`ggml_backend_sched_set_tensor_backend(sched, node, backend_cpu)`
on the output tensors of layers `il >= n_gpu_layers`. The sched
handles GPU↔CPU transfers at the op boundary. Weights stay on
GPU buffer; only the compute moves. Useful for "this op is broken
on this GPU" (Metal conv_transpose_1d hang, Intel Vulkan workgroup
limit), useless for "model doesn't fit."

**(b) Weight-residency offload** (~150-200 LOC, llama.cpp's
`--n-gpu-layers` pattern). Allocate two backend buffers at load
time: first N layers go on `c->backend` (GPU), rest on
`c->backend_cpu`. Each `voxtral4b_block` stores tensor pointers
that already live on the right backend. Graph builder produces
ops naturally placed by sched (each op's compute follows its
input weights). Properly fits the VRAM use case — N can be tuned
down until the GPU residence fits in available VRAM.

**For #60's voxtral4b VRAM problem, only (b) is useful.** The user
worked around it with `CRISPASR_KV_QUANT=q4_0 + CRISPASR_GGUF_MMAP=1`
(both already shipped); that combo is the recommended interim
answer until (b) lands.

**Background.** External feature request via #60: Voxtral 4B
specifically needs the ability to offload N transformer blocks to
CPU and / or pin the KV cache to CPU on GPU-weight builds. llama.cpp
exposes `--n-gpu-layers N` for this; we currently have no
equivalent. Today's escape hatches against VRAM pressure are:

- `CRISPASR_KV_QUANT=q8_0|q4_0` — halve / quarter the KV cache
  (already shipped, PLAN #60e, 9+ backends incl. voxtral4b)
- `CRISPASR_GGUF_MMAP=1` — don't double-allocate weights on load
  (already shipped, PLAN #51a / HISTORY §62)

That covers steady-state footprint, but not the case where the
model itself doesn't fit in VRAM. For that we'd need per-block
placement.

### 69a. N-layer CPU offload — `--n-gpu-layers` / env equivalent — VOXTRAL4B SHIPPED 2026-05-04, REST OPEN

The pattern to mirror is `src/kokoro.cpp:2174`'s per-op CPU pinning,
generalised to "first N transformer blocks":

```cpp
const int n_gpu_layers = env_int_default("CRISPASR_N_GPU_LAYERS", -1);  // -1 = all
if (n_gpu_layers >= 0 && n_gpu_layers < (int)hp.n_layers) {
    for (int il = n_gpu_layers; il < (int)hp.n_layers; il++) {
        // Pin block `il`'s Q/K/V/O/FFN tensors to backend_cpu via
        // ggml_backend_sched_set_tensor_backend().
    }
}
```

Where: per-backend graph builder (`build_graph_llm_kv` for voxtral4b,
analogous for voxtral / qwen3_asr / glm_asr / granite_speech /
gemma4_e2b / orpheus / mimo_asr / omniasr-llm). Tag the layer index
on each block's tensors when constructing the graph; the loop above
walks them and CPU-pins at sched-alloc time.

CLI plumbing: `whisper_params.n_gpu_layers` (already exists from
upstream whisper at `examples/common.h:25`!) → forward into each
backend's `init()` path, threaded through to the graph builder.

Per-backend implementation list (rough order: highest-VRAM first):

1. **voxtral4b** (3.4 B LLM) — direct request from #60. Largest VRAM
   footprint of the LLM-decode backends.
2. **voxtral** (3 B Mistral)
3. **qwen3_asr** (0.6 B Qwen3)
4. **granite_speech** + granite-4.1 / 4.1-plus / 4.1-nar
5. **gemma4_e2b** (E2B = ~5 B effective; widening capabilities just
   landed in cf20c08, layer offload would be the natural follow-up)
6. **glm_asr**
7. **orpheus** (Llama 3.2 3 B talker)
8. **mimo_asr**
9. **omniasr-llm**
10. **vibevoice-tts** — Qwen2 7B; may need the most help on VRAM

Skip: ASR-only encoders (parakeet, canary, cohere, fc-ctc, wav2vec2,
firered-asr, moonshine) — encoder graphs aren't layered the same way
and the VRAM footprint isn't a problem.

#### Voxtral4b status (2026-05-04)

Shipped end-to-end:

- New `core_gguf::load_weights_split(path, gpu, cpu, is_gpu_fn,
  user, tag, &out)` in `src/core/gguf_loader.{h,cpp}` partitions
  tensors into two backend buffers by predicate. Manual per-tensor
  alignment + offset; no mmap on the split path (the mmap fast paths
  in load_weights() require contiguous tensor regions, which the
  partition can't satisfy — acceptable, users hitting VRAM pressure
  are accepting the alloc-and-copy hit to fit at all).
- voxtral4b reads `CRISPASR_N_GPU_LAYERS=N` (default -1 = legacy
  single-backend load). When N is in [0, 26), tensors named
  `blk.<il>.*` go to GPU iff `il < N`; everything else (audio enc,
  projection, embeddings, output_norm) stays on GPU.
- ggml_backend_sched picks up the per-tensor backend assignment
  automatically and routes compute to follow weights — no graph-
  builder changes needed.

Validated on JFK (11 s / 26 layers / Q4_K weights):

```
N=-1 default :  weight residency: legacy GPU buffer
N=0          :  gpu=763 MiB (428 tensors), cpu=1643 MiB (286 tensors)
N=13         :  gpu=1585 MiB (571 tensors), cpu=821 MiB (143 tensors)
N=26         :  legacy single-backend load (not split)
```

All four configs produce bit-identical correct transcripts.

#### Remaining work for #69a

Same plumbing applied to the other 9 LLM-decode backends from the
list above. Each backend needs:

1. A small `<backend>_layer_of(tensor_name)` helper to extract the
   layer index from its naming scheme (most use `blk.<N>.*`).
2. The split-load env-var dispatch in its `load_model` path.
3. The `model.buf_cpu` field + free-on-shutdown.
4. Pass `backend_cpu` through to the load_model signature.

Mechanical and bounded. Worth doing per-backend on demand rather
than preemptively — voxtral4b was the requesting user's actual ask
(#60), and the test surface for each backend's layered tensor
naming + `backend_cpu` setup is its own verification.

### ~~69b. KV-only CPU offload (`CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU=1`)~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-04

Allocates `ctx->kv_buf` on `ctx->backend_cpu` instead of `ctx->backend`
even when GPU weights are active. Useful for users with very long
context where even Q4_0 KV won't fit in VRAM. Implementation pattern:

```cpp
ggml_backend_t kv_backend = core_attn::kv_backend_from_env(
    ctx->backend, ctx->backend_cpu, "<backend_tag>");
ctx->kv_buf = ggml_backend_alloc_buffer(kv_backend, k_size + v_size);
```

The helper falls back to `gpu_backend` when `CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU` is
unset or `0`, and warns if CPU offload is requested but no CPU
backend is available. Verbose log identifies whether the KV cache is
on `cpu` or `gpu`.

The expensive part isn't the alloc — every attention step copies the
KV slice GPU↔CPU↔GPU. Typically slower than just using `KV_QUANT=q4_0`
to fit KV in VRAM. Documented in `docs/cli.md` Memory footprint as
"try KV_QUANT first."

Stacks cleanly with #69e — verified `CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU=1
CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_K=q8_0 CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_V=q4_0` on voxtral4b
produces 169 MiB on CPU with the correct transcript.

Per-backend coverage (extended 2026-05-04 from 6 → 10): voxtral,
voxtral4b, omniasr, qwen3_asr, granite_speech, orpheus, glm_asr,
gemma4_e2b, mimo_asr, qwen3_tts.

### ~~69e. Asymmetric K-vs-V cache quantization (llama.cpp parity)~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-04

Today our `KV_QUANT=<type>` flag (#60e, shipped) applies the same
precision to both K and V. llama.cpp exposes the two halves
independently (`--cache-type-k` / `--cache-type-v`) because the
sensitivity profiles are very different:

- **V** quantizes down well — it gets used as `softmax(QK^T) · V`.
  The softmax already concentrates probability mass, so per-element
  errors get averaged across attended positions. `q4_0` V is
  typically indistinguishable from F16 in PPL.
- **K** is the fragile half — `QK^T / sqrt(d)` produces attention
  scores *before* the softmax, and softmax exponentiates. Errors
  here distort *which* positions get attended to. K usually wants
  Q8_0 or higher for the same PPL floor.

The common llama.cpp recipe is `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q4_0` — about 40 %
more KV memory savings than symmetric Q8_0, with PPL barely moved
on Llama-class models. We have headroom to push V lower than the
Q8_0 we shipped in #60e.

Most useful on the LLM-decode backends where KV is the dominant
memory pressure (voxtral4b, granite-speech-4.x, qwen3, mimo-asr).

#### Implementation

Split the env knob:

```
CRISPASR_KV_QUANT       (legacy; sets both)  → keep for back-compat
CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_K     (new; overrides KV_QUANT for K only)
CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_V     (new; overrides KV_QUANT for V only)
```

In each backend's `kv_init`, pick `k_type` and `v_type` independently
from these env vars (default both to `KV_QUANT`, default that to
F16). The K and V buffers already get separate `ggml_tensor`s in
all current backends, so the change is:

```cpp
ggml_type k_type = parse_kv_quant("CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_K", default_kv);
ggml_type v_type = parse_kv_quant("CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_V", default_kv);
ctx->kv_k = ggml_new_tensor_3d(meta, k_type, ...);
ctx->kv_v = ggml_new_tensor_3d(meta, v_type, ...);
```

(parse_kv_quant() falls back to `CRISPASR_KV_QUANT` when its
type-specific var is unset.)

#### Status (2026-05-04)

Plumbing landed across 10 LLM-decode backends:
voxtral, voxtral4b, omniasr, qwen3_asr, granite_speech, orpheus,
glm_asr, gemma4_e2b, mimo_asr, qwen3_tts. The first 6 went in
together; the tier-1 expansion (glm_asr / gemma4_e2b / mimo_asr /
qwen3_tts — they already used `kv_dtype_from_env`, so the upgrade
to the pair-aware helper was 5 LOC each) followed in the same
session.
The legacy `CRISPASR_KV_QUANT` keeps working unchanged; the new
`CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_K` / `_V` overrides take precedence per half.
Sanity-checked on JFK against voxtral4b and granite-speech-4.0-1b:

```
voxtral4b  F16/F16:        416 MiB
voxtral4b  Q8_0/Q8_0:      221 MiB  (47 % vs F16)
voxtral4b  Q8_0/Q4_0:      169 MiB  (59 % vs F16, 23 % vs sym Q8_0)
voxtral4b  Q4_0/Q4_0:      117 MiB  (72 % vs F16)
granite    Q8_0/Q4_0:      130 MiB
```

All four configs produced bit-identical correct transcripts on
JFK (short, English, easy). Deeper validation against longer
LibriSpeech clips + WER=0 floor regression is deferred — the
mechanism is correct and the fail-safe (legacy KV_QUANT) is
unchanged, so users can opt in conservatively.

Documentation: `docs/cli.md` Memory footprint section, llama.cpp
parity table.

#### Open follow-ups

- WER=0 floor validation on a long-context clip (LibriSpeech /
  longer than JFK's 11 s) for the Q8_0/Q4_0 asymmetric pair.
  Belongs in the #60e regression flow.
- Per-layer K/V quant (some llama.cpp users go finer — e.g.
  lower precision in middle layers). Adds a third dimension of
  ablation surface that isn't justified until the whole-cache
  asymmetric pair has WER=0 evidence on long context.

### Approach (do these in order)

1. ~~Land `CRISPASR_N_GPU_LAYERS` for voxtral4b~~ — DONE 2026-05-04.
   New `core_gguf::load_weights_split()` helper + voxtral4b dispatch.
   Validated bit-identical on JFK at N=-1, 0, 13, 26. Other 9
   LLM-decode backends remain — track per-backend, not preemptive.
   *(#69a)*
2. ~~Land `CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU`~~ — DONE 2026-05-04, shipped across
   all 6 LLM-decode backends in one go alongside #69e. Helper
   `core_attn::kv_backend_from_env(gpu, cpu, tag)` lives in
   `src/core/attention.h`. Verified on voxtral4b that KV cache lands
   on CPU with the correct transcript and stacks with asymmetric
   KV_QUANT_K/_V. *(#69b)*
3. ~~Land `CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_K` / `_V`~~ — DONE 2026-05-04, shipped
   across all 6 LLM-decode backends in one go (voxtral, voxtral4b,
   omniasr, qwen3_asr, granite_speech, orpheus). Plumbing is
   mechanical and identical per backend, so the per-backend rollout
   risk that gates 69a doesn't apply here. WER=0 long-context
   validation is the open piece. *(#69e)*

### Files touched (per backend, approximate)

```
include/crispasr.h                       — public API tweak (n_gpu_layers field)
src/<backend>.{h,cpp}                    — graph builder layer tag
                                            + kv_init backend pick
examples/cli/whisper_params.h            — already has n_gpu_layers
examples/cli/cli.cpp                     — surface --n-gpu-layers flag
                                            (or rely on env var only)
examples/cli/crispasr_backend_<name>.cpp — forward params.n_gpu_layers
                                            into init()
docs/cli.md                              — document the new flag(s)
```

### Out of scope

- A `--cpu-mask` style fine-grained tensor offload (per-tensor CPU
  pinning across the whole graph): too much UI surface for the
  user-side win.
- Per-tensor mmap-from-disk inference (`memory-mapped weights` with
  cold-loaded tensors): that's a separate, larger feature — track as
  its own item if it ever becomes a priority.

## 70. Streaming TTS via chunked VAE decode (latency win, vibevoice / qwen3-tts)

**Effort:** Medium-large.

**Background.** Issue #52 surfaced a chunked-VAE patch from
[`geneing`](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR/issues/52#issuecomment-4366745018)
that re-runs the σ-VAE decoder on small chunks of the latent stream
instead of one big graph. Their measurement showed a speed regression
because re-running the ggml graph N times pays per-call setup
(`sched_reset` + `sched_alloc_graph` + the kernel-launch ramp-up) on
every chunk. So that patch isn't useful for the Intel-Arc Vulkan
workgroup-limit bug it was filed against — that's already fixed by
the CPU fallback in `31795a7` / `VIBEVOICE_VAE_BACKEND=cpu`.

**But chunking is the right shape for a latency feature, not a
throughput one.** If we ever want streaming TTS — the listener
starts hearing audio before AR completes — we'll need chunked VAE
*plus* the rest of the pipeline. A `--stream` mode for `--tts` would
look like: emit a 24 kHz PCM chunk every K AR steps, written to
stdout / streamed over HTTP, while the AR loop continues. Time-to-
first-byte drops from "full TTS wall-clock" to "K AR steps + one
chunked-VAE pass."

This is **not the same project as the Intel-Vulkan workgroup fix.**
We'd want a chunked VAE that's well-engineered for latency rather
than borrowed from a workgroup-limit workaround.

### Three pieces required

1. **Persistent VAE compute-graph reused across chunks.** The
   per-call `sched_reset` + `sched_alloc_graph` overhead is what
   killed geneing's prototype's speed. Pattern to mirror is
   qwen3-tts's `O15` graph reuse (see `src/qwen3_tts.cpp:1037`):
   build the graph once at `Lk = max_chunk_latents`, pin the
   tensor topology, reuse the cached gallocr plan across all
   chunk decode calls. Net cost is one `set_rows`-style
   "where to write this chunk's output" op per call, not a full
   rebuild.

2. **Causal padding on the σ-VAE conv stack.** The σ-VAE
   transposed-conv stack has receptive field that crosses chunk
   boundaries — naive chunking will produce phase artefacts at
   the boundaries. Causal padding (left-pad each chunk with the
   previous chunk's tail context, drop the first L padding samples
   from the output) makes the chunk decode equivalent to the full
   decode at chunk boundaries. Reference: kokoro and voxtral4b
   already use causal-conv1d padding for streaming-encoder paths;
   the σ-VAE side has a different topology but the math is the
   same.

3. **Chunked transfer in the HTTP TTS endpoint.** Once #58's
   `POST /v1/audio/speech` lands (vkrmch's PR), wire chunked-
   transfer-encoded audio output for clients with `Accept:
   audio/wav; chunked` (or a `stream=true` request field). cpp-
   httplib has chunked-transfer support out of the box. Without
   this piece the latency win can't reach the network — server
   would compute chunks fast but still wait until the last chunk
   to flush.

### Backends in scope

- **vibevoice TTS** (σ-VAE decoder) — primary target, the patch
  origin. Largest latency win because vibevoice is positioned as
  the realtime TTS backend.
- **qwen3-tts codec decode** — different architecture (12 Hz codec
  vocoder, not a σ-VAE) but the same chunked-decode-with-graph-
  reuse pattern applies. Already has graph reuse via `O15`; would
  extend that to chunked output.
- **kokoro iSTFTNet generator** — different shape again
  (deterministic vocoder, not a diffusion VAE). Chunking is
  cleaner here because the generator is straight-line; harder
  because the iSTFT inverse window has the same boundary
  artefact problem.

Skip out-of-scope: orpheus uses the SNAC codec which already
emits 24 kHz PCM in a single forward pass — chunking has no
latency win there.

### Approach

Pre-work: revisit geneing's
[chunked_vibevoice.patch](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/27326191/chunked_vibevoice.patch)
as a starting point — it nailed the chunking decomposition;
where it gave up was on the per-call overhead. Land the graph-
reuse fix first (mostly mechanical), benchmark to confirm the
regression is gone, then layer in the causal-padding and HTTP
chunked transfer.

### Files touched

- `src/vibevoice.cpp` (and `vibevoice_tts.cpp`) — chunked decode
  path with graph reuse + causal padding
- `examples/cli/crispasr_backend_vibevoice.cpp` — `--stream`
  output path: write each chunk's PCM to `stdout` as they
  complete, instead of buffering and writing one WAV at end
- `examples/cli/cli.cpp` — surface `--tts-stream` flag
- `examples/server/server.cpp` — chunked-transfer wiring for
  `/v1/audio/speech` (depends on #58 landing first)
- `docs/tts.md` — document the new flag + the streaming env
  var(s)
- `LEARNINGS.md` — document the per-call ggml graph overhead
  trap and the graph-reuse cure (geneing's patch is the
  cautionary tale)

### Out of scope for v1

- Multi-chunk look-ahead (lower latency at cost of slightly worse
  boundary behaviour) — a single look-ahead chunk is already a
  meaningful tuning knob; tuning past that adds complexity that
  isn't justified until we measure how good the v1 latency is.
- Non-vibevoice / non-qwen3-tts backends — kokoro / orpheus
  chunking is its own work item if anyone needs it.
- Any changes to AR decoding itself — the AR loop stays
  unchanged; only the post-AR codec / VAE side is chunked.

## ~~71. Test-runner under-invocation + cap-honesty audit~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-04 → [HISTORY §79](HISTORY.md)

## ~~72. gemma4_e2b / mimo_asr: GPU residency for Q4_K weights~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-04 → [HISTORY §79](HISTORY.md)

Apple Silicon Metal: gemma4-e2b 8.52 s → 3.95 s (2.2x), mimo-asr 27.13 s → 21.18 s (-22 %). One-line change per backend (load_weights to ctx->backend instead of ctx->backend_cpu). Linux/CUDA validation deferred — hardware-blocked from current host; expect at least the same range since dGPUs dominate CPU on matmul throughput even more than Apple Silicon.

## ~~73. Quant-safe KV cache write for canary / cohere / kyutai_stt~~ — SHIPPED 2026-05-04 → [HISTORY §79](HISTORY.md)

New core_attn::kv_cache_write helper (F16 → ggml_cpy(view) fast path; Q8_0/Q4_0 → ggml_set_rows(indices)). Migrated kyutai_stt (single-token decode), then canary + cohere (multi-token prefill, used existing position graph input as the row-index source). Read path: cast-on-read fallback then full ggml_flash_attn_ext migration on canary + cohere — drops the cast tax for full bandwidth saving on quant K/V.

Open follow-up: long-context perf comparison of cohere flash-attn vs cast-on-read (JFK is too short to surface the long-context win).

## 74. Feature-matrix uplift round 2 — chatterbox family + matrix tooling

After §79b shipped chatterbox + 3 sibling variants and the audit-drift cleanup brought test-all-backends.py to 39/39 backends, four follow-ups surfaced from re-reading the cap matrix. They cluster by user-visible value:

### 74a. Auto-route by `-l <lang>` for chatterbox family — TIER 1 (cheap, high value)

Today `--backend chatterbox` always loads the English base. A user passing `-l de` and `--backend chatterbox` should get auto-routed to `kartoffelbox-turbo`; `-l ar` should go to `lahgtna-chatterbox`. Mirrors the existing kokoro `-l de` → German backbone routing pattern. ~20 LOC in `examples/cli/crispasr_backend.cpp` dispatch (or in chatterbox adapter's `init`). No new cap; pure DX win.

### 74b. CAP_TRANSLATE / CAP_SRC_TGT_LANGUAGE in test-all-backends.py — TIER 1 (cheap, completes audit)

The binary's caps enum already has `CAP_TRANSLATE` (1 << 5) and `CAP_SRC_TGT_LANGUAGE` (1 << 12); declared by canary, granite-4.1, granite-4.1-plus, voxtral, qwen3 per `--list-backends-json`. The test script's `CAPABILITIES_KNOWN` doesn't have either. Adding them lights up granite-4.1-plus's translate path and exposes a regression gate for the others. ~30 LOC: extend `CAPABILITIES_KNOWN`, add `_test_translate` tier handler that runs `--translate -l de samples/jfk.wav` and asserts non-empty German output.

### 74c. CAP_VOICE_CLONING — TIER 2 (new cap bit, cross-cutting)

Currently no way to express "this backend accepts a reference WAV via `--voice <wav>`." Backends that do: chatterbox, qwen3-tts (base + 1.7b-base), vibevoice (1.5B base — distinct from the realtime preset path). New cap bit in `examples/cli/crispasr_backend.h`, declarations in those adapters, test-script tier that runs `--voice samples/jfk.wav --tts "test" --tts-output /tmp/cloned.wav` and asserts non-zero peak. ~80 LOC.

### 74d. Generated sortable/filterable feature matrix (`docs/feature-matrix.html`) — TIER 2 (tooling)

Today's README matrix is a hand-maintained Markdown table — every backend addition requires editing 17 rows. Replace with a generation script that calls `crispasr --list-backends-json`, normalizes, emits both:
  * `docs/feature-matrix.md` — checked-in Markdown table (regenerated by the script; CI gate could check freshness)
  * `docs/feature-matrix.html` — vanilla-JS standalone (clickable column-header sort, top-of-page filter input). No external JS deps. Single self-contained file, viewable offline.

README links to both. ~200 LOC across the generator script + the HTML template. Single source of truth: the binary's JSON. Eliminates the hand-edit drift that #61 / #63 / #71 had to keep chasing.

### 74e. Beam search for chatterbox T3 — TIER 3 (deferred)

Chatterbox T3 AR decode currently uses sampling (temp / top_p / min_p / repetition_penalty). Adding beam search would unlock `--beam-size N` for the backend and add a row to the feature matrix. Honest scope: ~200-300 LOC for parallel decode paths + length-normalised score accumulation + KV cache replication-or-sequential-with-separate-caches + early-termination handling. Plus validation that beam decode doesn't amplify the open Conformer rel-pos parity gap (matrix_bd 7.08 vs 10.06).

**Blocker:** the rel-pos parity gap dominates output quality today; beam search would be polish on a runtime that still has unresolved structural issues. Defer until parity closes — at that point beam search is an obvious win, but not before. Tracking here so it doesn't get lost.

---

## ~~75. /v1/audio/speech OpenAI feature-parity round 1~~ — **DONE → HISTORY §81**

Round 1 shipped: PR #63 merged (`cd30c46`), corrective batch (`d35940b`...`85302c5`), 75a/75b (`b932fa9`), 75d chunking (`0bff2d7`). 75c-opt-1 (server-side speed resampler) included. Remaining follow-ups (75c-opt-2 native duration knobs, 75e streaming/mp3/upload) are separate work items.

Remaining gaps documented in follow-up items: 75c-opt-2 (native-backend duration knobs), 75e (streaming response, mp3/opus encoding, voice upload/delete).

---

## 80. nano-cohere-transcribe-inspired perf + chunking tweaks

After studying [Deep-unlearning/nano-cohere-transcribe](https://github.com/Deep-unlearning/nano-cohere-transcribe)
(pure-PyTorch port of `CohereLabs/cohere-transcribe-03-2026`, 1.5–3.6×
faster than the native `transformers` path on CUDA), this entry surveys
which of its tricks port to CrispASR. The headline trick — CUDA-graph
capture of the per-token decoder step — turns out to be largely
redundant on Metal+ggml because PR #73's `sched_reserve` already paid
that bill. The smaller wins are still useful and are the focus here.

### 80a. Decoder graph-once, replay-N — measurement, parked

**Inspiration.** nano-cohere `_graph.py` pre-allocates fixed-shape KV
buffers `[B, H, max_kv, Dh]`, writes new K/V at a runtime `pos_idx` via
`index_copy_`, captures one CUDA graph per `(B, T_enc)`, and replays it
per token. Eliminates per-step kernel-launch overhead (3.62× win at
bs=1 on A100).

**Mapped to ggml.** The structural blocker in CrispASR is
`core/attention.h:148` — the F16 fast path bakes `n_past` into the
view byte-offset (`n_past * kv_k->nb[1]`), so each step rebuilds the
graph at a different topology. The quant path already uses
`ggml_set_rows(indices)` (line 173), the same indirection nano uses;
extending it to F16 is mechanical (verified: Metal/CUDA/Vulkan all
support `ggml_set_rows` with F16 destination). With that change, the
step graph could be built once and replayed N times, only updating
`embd`/`position`/`indices`/`sa_mask` via `ggml_backend_tensor_set`.

**Why this is parked.** Baseline measurement on cohere q4_k + Metal
(MTL0):

| clip            | total wall | enc compute  | dec build | dec alloc | dec compute | dec build+alloc / total |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| JFK 11 s        | 1356.8 ms  | 1114.3 (82%) |   3.0 ms  |  14.8 ms  |  115.7 ms   | **1.31 %**              |
| JFK ×3 = 30 s   | 3838.6 ms  | 3295.7 (86%) |   5.1 ms  |  28.4 ms  |  293.7 ms   | **0.87 %**              |

The encoder dominates (82–86%). Per-step decoder CPU overhead is
already in the noise on Metal because PR #73's
`ggml_backend_sched_reserve(... max-size graph ...)` (cohere.cpp:2210)
pre-sizes the gallocr so `gallocr_needs_realloc` returns false on
every step. A graph-once-replay-N change would save at most ~1 % of
total wall, with substantial code disruption (constant-shape K/V
read views also need a per-step mask, since `sa_L = offset + n_tokens`
also currently scales the read view).

**Decision.** Park until a CUDA backend ships — at that point the win
flips (CUDA per-kernel-launch overhead is exactly what nano fights),
and the F16 `ggml_set_rows` path may be needed anyway. Cohere already
has the `gf_decode_1` field declared (line 502) for that future
change.

### 80b. Energy-minimum chunk boundaries (in progress)

Cohere's long-form path at `src/cohere.cpp:1834-1901` cuts at exactly
`30 * sample_rate` samples — which slices mid-word. Port the
`_find_split_point_energy` helper from nano-cohere `chunk.py:61-80`:
within the last `boundary_context_seconds` (default 5 s) of each 30 s
window, scan in `min_energy_window_samples` (default 1600 = 100 ms)
non-overlapping slices and pick the lowest-RMS one as the cut point.

**Files:**
* `src/core/audio_chunking.h` — new header. Two functions:
  `audio_chunking::find_energy_min_split(span, search_start,
  search_end, win_samples) -> int` and
  `audio_chunking::split_at_energy_minima(span, sample_rate,
  max_chunk_s, search_window_s, win_samples) -> std::vector<std::pair<
  size_t,size_t>>` returning [begin,end) sample ranges.
* `src/cohere.cpp:1834-1901` — replace the fixed-step loop with a
  call to `split_at_energy_minima`; iterate the returned ranges.

**Acceptance:** JFK transcript byte-identical (single-chunk path
unaffected); 60 s synthetic clip's chunk boundary lands within a
quiet sub-window (verifiable by inspecting the cut-time printed by
`COHERE_VLOG`).

### 80c. CRISPASR_VERBOSE env override for cohere CLI (DONE this session)

Aligns cohere with the gemma4 / granite / firered / omniasr /
moonshine_streaming convention (env var or `-v` bumps backend
verbosity to 2 to print the perf report). One line in
`examples/cli/crispasr_backend_cohere.cpp`. Side benefit of the
investigation; without it, 80a couldn't be measured from the CLI.

### 80d. Cross-backend audit of fixed-time chunking (TODO)

Survey the long-form chunking strategy in every AR-decoder backend
(canary, voxtral, voxtral4b, vibevoice, kyutai-stt, gemma4_e2b,
qwen3-tts-talker). Anything cutting at `N * sample_rate` boundaries
inherits the same mid-word problem and gains from
`audio_chunking::split_at_energy_minima`. Investigate-only here; each
hit is its own one-line change.

### 80e. Eager warmup follow-up (TODO, low priority)

nano-cohere's `from_pretrained` does a 1 s silence transcribe on init
to amortize Metal kernel compile / first-shape gallocr setup. Easy to
add a `cohere_warmup(ctx)` call wired into model load. Worth ~50–
150 ms saved on the first user-visible call but not on steady state.
Leave for a later polish pass; if added, every backend gets its own
warmup hook.

### Out of scope (rejected ideas from nano)

* **Meta-init + `assign=True`** — PyTorch trick. CrispASR's mmap'd
  GGUF is already the moral equivalent.
* **bf16 autoselect** — backend dtype is controlled by the GGUF
  quant choice, not a runtime switch.
* **Decoder-batched chunk packing** with longest-first sort — the
  CrispASR cohere path already encodes-then-decodes per-chunk
  serially (line 1834-1899 recurses); converting to batched chunks
  needs a different graph shape and a real-world workload that hits
  this regime (multi-file CLI calls). Investigate when the demand
  appears.

## 81. Nemotron-Speech-Streaming-EN-0.6B — first cache-aware streaming-native ASR

[`nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b)
— NVIDIA Open Model License (NVOML), 600 M params, released
late 2025 / early 2026. **Cache-Aware FastConformer + RNN-T**, the
first model in the queue that's *streaming-native* rather than
batch-with-chunked-streaming-on-top. Mentioned by an outside reporter
in issue #85; `parakeet` and `kyutai-stt` are the closest
streaming-capable backends we ship today and neither targets
nemotron's latency/accuracy frontier.

### Why this is interesting

Quality-vs-latency curve from the published Open ASR Leaderboard
numbers (same eval set as our existing parakeet / canary / whisper):

| Chunk size | Right-context lookahead | Avg WER | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1120 ms | 13 frames (~1.04 s) | 6.93 % | best accuracy |
| 560 ms | 6 frames (~0.48 s) | 7.07 % | |
| 160 ms | 1 frame (~0.08 s) | 7.67 % | |
| 80 ms | 0 frames | 8.43 % | unique low-latency point |

Same `.gguf` for all four — `att_context_size=[70, R]` is a runtime
knob, not a retraining artifact. Reference points on our current
leaderboard:

| Model (batch) | Avg WER | RTFx |
|---|---:|---:|
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` (we ship this) | 6.34 % | high |
| `nemotron-streaming-en-0.6b` (1.12 s chunk) | 6.93 % | streaming |
| `canary-1b-v2` (we ship this) | 7.15 % | 749 |
| `whisper-large-v3` (we ship this) | 7.44 % | 145 |

Headline read: nemotron is **0.6 pp worse than batch parakeet on
average but better than canary-1b-v2 and whisper-large-v3** — and
crucially gets there with a fixed-size step rather than reading the
whole utterance. On AMI (conversational meetings) it actually wins
all of those (11.73 % vs 11.31/16.01/15.95). The 80 ms / 0-lookahead
/ 8.4 % WER point has no equivalent in our current lineup; it's the
real reason to consider this model.

### Architecture summary

```
WAV (16 kHz mono)
  → log-mel (80 bins, NeMo per-feature norm)
  → 4× conv subsampling pre-encode
  → 24× Cache-Aware FastConformer block
       · macaron FFN
       · multi-head SA w/ rel-pos shift  ← cache-aware (cached K/V from prior chunks)
       · depth-wise conv (kernel 9)      ← cache-aware (8-frame overlap-cache per layer)
       · macaron FFN
  → predictor LSTM (1-layer)
  → joint network + softmax
  → RNN-T blank/non-blank greedy (no TDT durations)
```

Frame stride after the 4× subsampling is 80 ms. Native PnC
(punctuation + capitalization). 530 k hours of training data
(NVIDIA Riva ASR set + Granary, including YouTube-Commons 109 k h,
YODAS2 102 k h, LibriLight 49 k h, Mosel 14 k h plus the standard
LibriSpeech / Fisher / WSJ / VoxPopuli / MLS / Common Voice /
Earnings22 mix).

### What we already have (~60–75 % reuse)

| Piece | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| FastConformer encoder body (24L, macaron FFN, SA + rel-pos, DW conv) | ✅ ready | `src/core/fastconformer.h` (shared by parakeet, canary, canary_ctc) |
| 4× conv subsampling pre-encode | ✅ ready | `core_conformer::build_pre_encode` |
| RNN-T predictor LSTM + joint head + greedy decode | ✅ ready (as TDT, where pure RNN-T = `n_tdt_durations=0`) | `src/parakeet.cpp` |
| Log-mel preprocessor (NeMo-style, 80 bins, per-feature normalization) | ✅ ready | `src/core/mel.cpp` |
| KV-cache infrastructure (`kv_cache_write` + offset-indexed reads) | ✅ ready | `src/core/attention.h` |
| Streaming CLI pipeline (`--stream`, `--stream-json` after #84) | ✅ ready | `examples/cli/crispasr_run.cpp` |
| BPE tokenizer (NeMo SentencePiece) | ✅ ready (parakeet pattern) | `src/core/bpe.h` |
| Streaming-aware backend example (per-layer state, chunk-by-chunk graph rebuild) | ✅ partial | `src/moonshine_streaming.cpp` |
| GGUF converter for NeMo `.nemo` checkpoints | ✅ partial | `models/convert-parakeet-to-gguf.py` template |

### What's missing — the actual new work

1. **Cache-aware FastConformer encoder graph.** Existing
   `core_conformer::build_block` consumes the whole `T` and emits
   the whole `T`; for streaming we need a variant that takes
   `(cached_K, cached_V, conv_state)` per layer and emits new K/V +
   new conv state alongside the audio output. Probably lives next
   to `fastconformer.h` as `fastconformer_streaming.h` so we don't
   regress parakeet/canary's bit-identical batch graphs.
2. **Per-layer streaming state on the context.** Modeled on
   `moonshine_streaming`'s pattern — per-layer K/V tensors persisted
   across `transcribe()` calls.
3. **`att_context_size` runtime knob.** Trivial — controls how many
   frames feed the encoder per step and the left-cache trim policy.
   No retraining, just masking + cache management differ.
4. **`.nemo` → GGUF converter.** ~80 % shared with parakeet's
   converter; cache-aware blocks have the same tensor names plus
   new metadata (`encoder.streaming.att_context_left_frames`,
   `encoder.streaming.dw_conv_state_size`, etc.).
5. **`examples/cli/crispasr_backend_nemotron.cpp`.** Thin adapter
   driving the streaming encoder per chunk and running the existing
   RNN-T greedy decode on each chunk's output. Shape is between
   `crispasr_backend_parakeet.cpp` and
   `crispasr_backend_moonshine_streaming.cpp`.
6. **`--live` integration.** Once the backend exists, `--stream` and
   `--stream-json` (#84) Just Work. The new backend would be a much
   better fit for `--live` than the current chunked-batch backends
   because per-chunk cost is constant rather than `O(window²)`.

### Effort breakdown

| Component | LOC | Reuse |
|---|---:|---|
| 80-bin log-mel front-end | ~30 | full reuse from parakeet |
| Cache-aware SA layer (K/V append + trim, rel-pos shift on `[cache | new]`) | ~120 | **new** — conceptually small but graph-topology-sensitive |
| Cache-aware DW conv layer (last 8 frames cached) | ~80 | **new** — pattern is identical to RNN state, just per-layer |
| Per-layer streaming state struct + lifecycle | ~60 | **new** — `nemotron_stream_state` on context |
| `att_context_size=[70,R]` runtime knob | ~30 | **new** — masking + trim policy |
| RNN-T predictor + joint + greedy (no durations) | ~50 | full reuse from parakeet |
| `.nemo` → GGUF converter | ~200 | ~80 % parakeet template + new streaming metadata |
| Diff harness reference (mel, enc per chunk, predictor, joint) | ~150 | parakeet template |
| Backend wrapper for main CLI | ~250 | midway between parakeet + moonshine_streaming |
| HF README + NVOML notice + auto-download registry entry | ~80 | template |
| **Total** | ~**1000–1300 LOC** | smaller than #58 (no LM body, no DeepStack injection) |

Headline new helper: a **streaming-aware FastConformer block builder**
that's reusable for any future cache-aware NeMo model (the same
streaming protocol covers Parakeet-Streaming, Canary-Streaming,
FastConformer-CTC-streaming if NVIDIA ever ships those — they're
rumored in the NeMo 26.x roadmap).

### What we'd need to dump from the Python ref for the diff harness

Stage taps:
- `mel_in` `[T_mel, 80]` — first chunk only
- `enc_pre_encode` `[T_enc, 512]` — after 4× subsampling
- `enc_block_0_post_sa` `[T_enc, 512]` — after first SA block
  (validates rel-pos + cache concat)
- `enc_block_0_post_conv` `[T_enc, 512]` — after first DW conv
  (validates conv-state cache)
- `enc_out` `[T_enc, 512]` — final encoder output for the chunk
- `predictor_state_after_blank` `[1, 640]`
- `joint_logits_step0` `[1, vocab+1]`

Six stages — a touch lighter than parakeet's diff harness because we
share the mel front-end. Multi-chunk validation needs the diff
harness to run twice with carried state (or a third entry point that
takes a list of chunks); the current `crispasr-diff` is single-shot
so this is a small extension to the harness itself.

### Risks / open questions

1. **Cache layout in the GGUF.** NeMo's `.nemo` archive embeds the
   streaming config but not the runtime cache shape. Need to pin
   the cache tensor layout (per-layer `[Dh, 70, n_heads]` for SA K
   and V, `[8, d_model]` for DW conv state) and check it survives
   the converter round-trip.
2. **Rel-pos shift on `[cache | new]`.** The existing
   `core_conformer::rel_shift` operates on a square `(2T-1, T)`
   tensor; with cached frames the table is `(2(L+R+1)-1, R+1)` —
   different layout, different shift indexing. Either extend
   `rel_shift` with a left-context offset or build a streaming-
   specific variant.
3. **Decoder state across chunks.** RNN-T predictor is autoregressive
   over emitted tokens, not over time; its LSTM state carries
   forward across chunks naturally. Confirm with the Python ref
   that emit-token-then-blank-to-advance still works at chunk
   boundaries (the joint sees encoder output for the current
   chunk; the predictor sees its state from the last emitted
   token, which may be from a previous chunk).
4. **Runtime tradeoff at 80 ms.** A 5-chunk window of left context
   + 1 frame new = 71 frames per encoder forward. On Apple Silicon
   Metal the per-launch overhead at that small a `T` may dominate
   — measure before claiming the 8.4 % WER point is actually usable
   live. CUDA path likely fine (graph capture amortizes the launch
   cost the way nano-cohere relied on, see #80a).
5. **PnC-stripped vs PnC-emitting WER comparison.** Open ASR
   Leaderboard scoring strips PnC; the 6.93 % avg is on stripped
   text. Our `firered_punc` post-processor adds PnC to backends that
   don't emit it natively — for nemotron we'd want to *not* run it
   (the model emits PnC already and re-punctuating can hurt). Wire
   a backend capability flag so `--punctuation` is a no-op when the
   backend is PnC-native.

### When to do this

**Not yet.** Two reasons to wait:

1. The streaming pipeline only just got `--stream-json` (issue #84)
   and the rolling-buffer fix; we want a few weeks of real wrappers
   building on it before we add a backend that's specifically
   tailored to it. If the structured-output API needs to evolve
   (e.g., adding word-level probability streams), better to find
   that out before nemotron locks in expectations.
2. The user demand is one outside-reporter mention so far (issue
   #85). Worth waiting until either a second user asks or a
   concrete production use case (live captioning, voice agent)
   needs sub-200 ms ASR. The 6.93 % batch number isn't an
   improvement over what we ship — only the streaming-native
   property is.

When demand materializes: **realistic estimate 3–5 days of focused
work** for someone who's already touched parakeet/canary, plus
benchmarking against the upstream Open ASR Leaderboard table to
confirm parity on the published WERs.

## 86. Per-backend flash-attention wiring (CrisperWeaver-driven)

**Status:** open. Plumbing complete in 0.6.2 (commit `ff5536a6`),
kernel-level wiring per backend is the remaining work.

### Context

CrisperWeaver's *Settings → Performance → ASR flash-attention*
toggle ships via `crispasr_session_open_with_params` (open params
struct v2 added in 0.6.2). The toggle threads through to a thread-
local `g_open_flash_attn_tls` that every backend's init arm can
read to set `cparams.flash_attn` on its context_params struct.

**Today only whisper actually consumes the flag at the kernel
level** — `whisper_context_params` already has a `flash_attn` field
that whisper.cpp branches on internally (it switches to
`ggml_flash_attn_ext` for the QKV → softmax → V product when set).

Other backends accept the toggle but their compute graphs still
build the historical `ggml_soft_max_ext(KQ)` path. For users on
Metal, that's a measurable perf gap on every long-running LLM
backend (orpheus, voxtral, qwen3 ASR, qwen3-tts, granite-speech,
chatterbox-T3, gemma4-e2b).

### Per-backend status

| Backend | Has `use_gpu` field | Has `flash_attn` field | Compute graph branch | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| whisper | ✅ (whisper.cpp upstream) | ✅ | ✅ | DONE |
| parakeet | ✅ | ❌ | — | Small (Conformer encoder) |
| canary | ✅ | ❌ | — | Small (encoder SA + decoder XA) |
| qwen3 (asr) | ✅ | ❌ | — | Medium (Whisper-like enc + Qwen3 LLM) |
| cohere | ✅ | ❌ | — | Small (Conformer encoder) |
| granite_speech | ✅ | ❌ | — | Medium (Conformer + Granite LLM) |
| voxtral | ✅ | ❌ | — | Medium (Whisper enc + Mistral 3B) |
| voxtral4b | ✅ | ❌ | — | Medium (causal enc + SWA decoder) |
| vibevoice | ✅ | ❌ | — | Small (σ-VAE encoder + Qwen2.5 talker) |
| qwen3_tts | ✅ | ❌ | — | Medium (talker + code-predictor) |
| orpheus | ✅ | ❌ | — | Small-Medium (Llama 3.2 3B AR loop) |
| kokoro | ✅ | ❌ | — | Small (StyleTTS2-derived; less impact) |
| chatterbox | ✅ | ❌ | — | Medium (T3 AR + S3Gen flow-matching) |

### Approach (per-backend recipe)

For each backend with a transformer attention block:

1. Add `bool flash_attn` to `*_context_params` (default-init to true
   in `*_context_default_params()`).
2. Plumb `g_open_flash_attn_tls → cparams.flash_attn` in
   `crispasr_session_open_explicit`'s arm for that backend (mirror
   the existing `cparams.use_gpu` line).
3. In the compute graph, swap the QKV path:
   - Before: `ggml_soft_max_ext(ggml_mul_mat(K, Q), scale)` then
     `ggml_mul_mat(V_T, softmax_out)`.
   - After: branch on `cparams.flash_attn`:
     - true → `ggml_flash_attn_ext(Q, K, V, mask, scale, ...)`
     - false → keep the historical path.
4. Verify the Metal kernel for `flash_attn_ext` exists for the
   relevant head dim. Most are covered (D ∈ {64, 80, 96, 112, 128})
   but check before committing.
5. Diff-harness round-trip: dump pre/post-attention tensors with
   the flag on vs off, confirm the kernels agree to 1e-3 (Metal
   F16 fast-math drift is the typical failure mode — use
   `GGML_PREC_F32` op_param if needed; same fix as #83).

### Recommended order

1. **orpheus + chatterbox-T3** — Llama-style AR loops, biggest
   wall-clock win on long generations (3 B Llama / T3 dominate
   the synth budget). Reuses the same `ggml_flash_attn_ext` pattern
   per-block.
2. **voxtral / voxtral4b / qwen3 ASR / granite-speech** — LLM-based
   ASR backends where flash-attn helps both the Whisper-style
   encoder and the LLM decoder.
3. **qwen3-tts** — talker is Qwen3-style transformer; same recipe
   as qwen3 ASR.
4. **parakeet / canary / cohere** — Conformer encoders. Lower per-
   call benefit but sums up for batch-transcribe users.
5. **vibevoice / kokoro** — smallest impact; do last or skip.

### Effort estimate

~4–6 hours per LLM backend (orpheus/voxtral/qwen3/granite/chatterbox),
~2 hours per Conformer (parakeet/canary/cohere). Total realistic
sweep: 2–3 focused days, can be split across separate PRs since
each backend is independent.

## 87. `gpu_backend` runtime selector (multi-backend ggml build)

**Status:** open. Needs ggml-side support to land first.

### Context

CrisperWeaver's *Settings → Performance* exposes an "ASR on GPU"
boolean today. The deeper knob — picking BETWEEN Metal, CUDA,
Vulkan at runtime when more than one is built into libcrispasr —
isn't doable yet because each `*_init_from_file` calls a single
`ggml_backend_*_init()` directly, and the CMake flag picks which
ggml backend gets compiled in.

### What ggml supports today

`ggml_backend_*_init()` returns a per-backend handle. Multiple
backends CAN compile into one binary (`-DGGML_METAL=ON
-DGGML_VULKAN=ON` builds both); each backend's init function lives
behind its own `#ifdef`, and the runtime can call any of them. What
ggml doesn't yet have is a uniform "auto-pick the best available"
selector — that's the missing piece.

### Approach when we tackle it

1. Add `crispasr_select_backend(const char* hint)` helper that
   resolves a hint string (`"auto" / "metal" / "cuda" / "vulkan" /
   "cpu"`) to a `ggml_backend_t` using `#ifdef GGML_METAL` /
   `#ifdef GGML_CUDA` / `#ifdef GGML_VULKAN` chains. `auto`
   prefers Metal on macOS, CUDA on Linux+NV, Vulkan on Linux+AMD
   or Windows, CPU as fallback.
2. Refactor every per-backend `*_init_from_file()` to take a
   `ggml_backend_t* preferred_backend` param (or read a thread-
   local set by a new `crispasr_session_open_params_v3`).
3. Add `gpu_backend_hint` (string field) to the open params struct
   v3.
4. Plumb through CrisperWeaver's `AdvancedTranscribeOptions` →
   `LoadModel` → `openWithParams`.

### Effort estimate

~1 week of focused work — touches every backend's init path. Best
done as a separate phased PR, one backend per commit.

## 90. Session-API beam_size — per-backend wiring

May 2026:
  * Shipped `crispasr_session_set_beam_size` (commit 958e6bd7).
  * Whisper consumes it natively (switches sampling strategy to
    BEAM_SEARCH with the supplied width).
  * **Five backends wired** via runtime `<backend>_set_beam_size`
    setters in their per-backend C API:
    - kyutai-stt (also kyutai / moshi-stt aliases) — setter
      pre-existed; just needed to be called from
      `transcribe_single`.
    - moonshine — same.
    - omniasr (LLM variant; CTC ignores) — same.
    - **glm-asr** — added `glm_asr_set_beam_size` (new public
      symbol) + dispatch wire.
    - **firered** — added `firered_asr_set_beam_size` (new
      public symbol) + dispatch wire.
  * CrisperWeaver's batch worker pool drives all six (whisper +
    five) end-to-end via its sticky-setter protocol; beamSearch
    is pool-eligible across that whole set.
  * `nm libcrispasr` confirms all five `<backend>_set_beam_size`
    plus the unified `crispasr_session_set_beam_size` are
    exported.

**Still gapped** — three backend families need new C surface on
their high-level transcribe API before the session wrapper can
plumb `s->beam_size` through. Each is more substantial than the
"add a runtime setter" pattern above because the beam-decode
path doesn't live in the backend library; the CLI wraps it
externally:

| Backend | What's needed |
|---|---|
| granite / granite-4.1 / granite-4.1-plus / granite-4.1-nar | The granite library exposes `granite_speech_transcribe(ctx, samples, n_samples)` — no beam, no params struct, just text. The CLI wrapper at `crispasr_backend_granite.cpp` runs its OWN beam decode via `core_beam_decode::run_with_probs(ctx_, logits, replay, cfg)` after pulling logits out of granite. Wiring beam search into the session API needs either: (a) move the `core_beam_decode` call into the granite library + new public `granite_speech_transcribe_with_beam(ctx, samples, n_samples, beam_size)`, or (b) expose granite's logits + replay buffer publicly so the session dispatcher can run `core_beam_decode` itself. Option (a) is cleaner — ~3-4 hours per granite variant. |
| voxtral / voxtral4b | Beam search via internal `voxtral_decode_beam` (not exposed). Same options: (a) public `voxtral_transcribe_with_params(ctx, samples, n_samples, voxtral_decode_params{beam_size, ...})` or (b) expose internal beam decoder. |
| qwen3-asr | Same shape — internal beam, no public surface. |

Each needs ~3-4 hours of careful per-backend work (read beam
path, decide a/b, write the new surface, wire from
`transcribe_single`, add a Catch2 smoke test). Total estimate
~1-1.5 days for the remaining three families. Each is
independent — can ship one at a time.

## 91. CrispASR CLI features missing from CrisperWeaver

While auditing the feature matrix for §90 we found a handful of
CLI knobs CrisperWeaver doesn't expose. Tracked here so the
gap is visible:

* `--offset-t MS` / `--duration MS` — process only a time window
  of the audio. Useful for "transcribe minute 5–10" workflows.
  Needs an engine-side `audio[t0:t0+d]` slice + timestamp shift
  (similar mechanics to the existing resume-offset routing).
  Estimate: 1 day end-to-end (CrispASR Dart binding + UI).
* `--alt N` / `--alt-n N` — alternative token candidates with
  probabilities. Power-user feature for transcript correction.
  C surface: would need an "alternates" array on the
  segment/word structs, plus a runtime cap. ~2 days end-to-end.
* Whisper decoder fallback knobs (`--word-thold`,
  `--entropy-thold`, `--logprob-thold`, `--no-speech-thold`,
  `--no-fallback`, `--temperature-inc`) — already in the Dart
  binding's TranscribeOptions, just not exposed in
  CrisperWeaver's Advanced Options widget. Trivial — half a day
  to add the UI rows + localised strings.
* Subtitle line formatting (`--max-len`, `--split-on-word`,
  `--split-on-punct`) — whisper context-params field today;
  CrisperWeaver formats post-hoc instead. Quality-of-life win
  for SRT export. ~1 day.
* Token suppression (`--suppress-nst`, `--suppress-regex`) —
  niche; whisper-specific.
* `--carry-initial-prompt` — sticky vs reset behaviour for the
  initial prompt across segments. Edge case, ~1 hour.
* `--print-confidence` — per-token confidence in JSON / WTS
  exports. Segments already carry a `confidence` field;
  exporters could surface per-token.

None of these are blocking; they're listed so the next
parity-pass audit doesn't have to re-discover them.
