# Issue #348 — Chatterbox Multilingual V3 parity port

## NOW

- [x] Read the full issue and audit the current official GitHub, model repo,
  and production V3 Space.
- [x] Pin source model revision
  `5bb1f6ee58e50c3b8d408bc82a6d3740c2db6e18` and production pairing
  `t3_mtl23ls_v3.safetensors` + original `s3gen.pt` / `s3gen.safetensors`.
- [x] Correct converter checkpoint selection and make the V3 pair explicit.
- [x] Make the Python diff blueprint multilingual and drive all clone
  conditionals from the fixture voice rather than unrelated built-in conds.
- [x] Verify `.safetensors` converter inputs tensor-for-tensor against the
  upstream `.pt` states; convert explicit V3 F16 T3 and S3Gen GGUFs.
- [x] Quantize with `crispasr-quantize`; use staged F16/Q8/Q4 parity to set
  precision carve-outs for sampling, CFM trajectory, and vocoder tensors.
- [x] Dump a multilingual voice-clone `-ref.gguf`, run `crispasr-diff` from
  front ends through AR tokens, CFM mel, vocoder stages, and PCM, and publish
  it under `chatterbox-v3/de-jfk/ref.gguf` in regression fixtures (fixture
  commit `7982e8dd8e0d53c344681335b00239773300a7aa`).
- [x] Run local unit/ABI/CLI tests plus multilingual live synthesis and closed
  loop R/C/B TTS→ASR clone roundtrips with speaker-similarity evidence.
- [x] Add the exact V3 artifacts to the registry, publish the six F16/Q8/Q4
  files (model commit `c45504bb8d55473a2213db17ec472ed11b69056a`), and verify
  registry quant/companion substitution against the SSD cache.
- [x] Repeat conversion/parity/live roundtrips with CUDA in the dedicated
  `chr1str/crispasr-chatterbox-v3-issue-348-cuda-parity` Kaggle kernel,
  preserving JSONL progress, logs, JSON summaries, and WAV artifacts.
- [x] Rebase-merged PR #354 at `278e3fbf` after every required GitHub check
  passed; answer #348 with linked evidence.

## Acceptance gates

- The Python oracle imports the actual multilingual V3 driver and passes an
  explicit ISO language ID through the multilingual tokenizer.
- Every GGUF records the selected upstream checkpoint; generic fallback cannot
  silently replace V3 with V2 or pair V3 T3 with the retired V3 vocoder.
- `crispasr-diff` reports both cosine and norm/scale checks. Quant acceptance is
  based on decoded output and roundtrip results, not cosine alone.
- Cross-language cloning uses a real generated reference R, clone C, and
  baseline B: C is non-silent, ASR(C) preserves the target text, and speaker
  similarity satisfies `cos(C,R) > cos(B,R)`.
- CPU/Metal success is not CUDA evidence; the same pinned commit and artifacts
  must pass on a real Kaggle NVIDIA GPU.

## Local evidence checkpoint

- Exact upstream state audit: S3Gen safetensors has 2,489/2,489 shared tensors
  byte-identical to `s3gen.pt`; its only omitted key is the upstream-declared
  non-persistent tokenizer window. VoiceEncoder has 16/16 exact tensors.
- `crispasr-diff`, German/JFK reference, canonical Q4: **32 pass, 0 fail,
  2 intentional skips**. T3 condition cosine/norm = 0.995116/0.9995; S3Gen
  encoder = 0.988826/0.9963; CFM mel = 0.994839/0.9775; isolated vocoder and
  PCM stages are effectively 1.0.
- Q4 policy: S3Tokenizer proj-down cosine improves 0.999477 -> 0.999929 and
  downstream T3 condition cosine 0.9855 -> 0.9951 with the Q8 floor. The
  built-in quantizer reproduces the manually tested artifacts byte-for-byte.
- Closed-loop generated R/C/B: Kokoro-generated English R -> Chatterbox German
  C roundtrips the complete target through Parakeet V3. TitaNet speaker cosine
  is `C,R = 0.792725` vs un-cloned `B,R = 0.431873`.
- Hermetic Chatterbox/registry/Parakeet language-routing set: 76/76 pass;
  public CLI capability/dispatch tests: 12/12 pass; converter tests: 5/5 pass.
- Model-backed Parakeet long-form controls: multilingual V3 Q4_K passes both
  231-second issue-#350 cases (7 assertions; gap-fill recovered 99 words), and
  the preserved Japanese path passes its 42-second live case at Q8_0 (6
  assertions). Japanese Q4_K reproduced its documented TDT quantization
  failure (2/3 keyword occurrences), so it is not represented as a green TDT
  artifact; Q8_0 is the release-quality Japanese TDT control.
- Kaggle P100/SM60 CUDA gate at exact CrispASR commit `ea3302ed`: the pinned
  converter and quantizer reproduced 313 T3 + 2,285 S3 tensor names, shapes,
  types and provenance; native CUDA diff against the published Python oracle
  passed **32/0/2**; all 23 supported languages emitted finite/non-silent
  audio through the C ABI; nine supported European languages produced nonempty
  Parakeet ASR roundtrips; and independent Kokoro R / Chatterbox C / default B
  scored `cos(C,R)=0.769132 > cos(B,R)=0.491945`, with exact target ASR for C
  and B. The worker's preinstalled PyTorch excludes SM60, so a fresh
  Python-on-CUDA dump was explicitly recorded unsupported; the authoritative
  CPU Python oracle → native CUDA diff passed in full.
