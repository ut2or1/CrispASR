# Streaming & live transcription

CrispASR supports three streaming modes — pipe input, microphone
capture, and continuous live mode — and per-token confidence output.
All work with every supported backend.

## Pipe mode (`--stream`)

```bash
# Pipe audio from ffmpeg, sox, or any tool that outputs raw PCM:
ffmpeg -i audio.wav -f s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 - | \
    crispasr --stream -m model.gguf
```

Sliding-window chunking, default 10 s window with 3 s step and 200 ms
overlap. Tune via `--stream-step`, `--stream-length`, `--stream-keep`.

Quality-control flags supported in streaming mode:

- `--vad`, `--vad-model`, `--vad-threshold`, `--vad-min-speech-duration-ms`, `--vad-min-silence-duration-ms`, `--vad-speech-pad-ms`
- `--punc-model` and `--no-punctuation`

Notes:

- With VAD enabled, each streaming window is segmented before ASR. Silent windows are skipped instead of being decoded.
- `--punc-model` applies after streamed chunk transcription, matching file-mode post-processing.
- `--alt` / `--alt-n` are file-mode features. They currently do not print token alternatives from `--stream`, `--mic`, or `--live`.
- File-oriented output flags such as `-osrt`, `-ovtt`, `-oj`, and `-of` do not apply to `--stream` / `--mic` / `--live`; streaming writes transcripts to stdout (or JSON-Lines events with `--stream-json`).

## Structured streaming output (`--stream-json`)

For wrappers (browser bridges, live-translation pipelines, captioning
UIs) that need to distinguish a still-evolving partial from a
finalized utterance, pass `--stream-json`. CrispASR then emits one
JSON object per line on stdout — never plain text — and FireRed VAD
diagnostics stay off stderr unless you opt in with
`--firered-vad-debug`.

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.wav -f s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 - 2>/dev/null \
  | crispasr --stream --stream-json -m model.gguf \
      --vad --vad-model firered-vad.gguf \
      --stream-final-on-silence-ms 800
```

Event types:

| `type` | When | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `partial` | A streaming step produced new text for the open utterance. At most one `partial` per `utterance_id` per step — multiple VAD slices belonging to the same utterance within a step are concatenated. | `utterance_id`, `text`, `t0`, `t1` |
| `final` | Trailing silence ≥ `--stream-final-on-silence-ms` (default `800`) after the last detected speech closed the open utterance. In the default `--stream-final-mode redecode` `text` is produced by re-running the backend on the buffered utterance PCM (covers `[t0..t1]`); in `prefix` mode `text` is a prefix accumulator stitched with the last partial. | `utterance_id`, `text`, `t0`, `t1` |
| `silence` | A streaming step produced no speech slices. Emitted regardless of whether an utterance is still open, so wrappers always see a timeline heartbeat. | `t` |

Stream-contract guarantees:

- Once an `utterance_id` finalizes, its audio is bookmarked and never re-opens a later `utterance_id`. Earlier text will not reappear in later utterances' partials.
- Finalization fires as soon as `now - last_speech_end_sample ≥ --stream-final-on-silence-ms`, independent of the rolling-window length. A 260 ms silence threshold with `--stream-length 18000` finalizes ~260 ms after the speaker stops, not ~18 s later.
- `final.t1 = last_speech_end_sample / 16 kHz` and the redecode buffer is trimmed to `[utterance_start_sample, last_speech_end_sample]`, so `final.text` describes exactly the `[t0..t1]` interval (trailing silence past `t1` is not part of the decoded region).

Sample stream:

```json
{"type":"partial","utterance_id":1,"text":"is that they can be tuned and adjusted","t0":10.20,"t1":13.20}
{"type":"partial","utterance_id":1,"text":"is that they can be tuned and adjusted for a specific","t0":10.20,"t1":16.20}
{"type":"final","utterance_id":1,"text":"is that they can be tuned and adjusted for a specific hardware target.","t0":10.20,"t1":17.80}
{"type":"silence","t":18.60}
```

Live-translation wrappers can show `partial` events in a draft pane
and only ship `final` events to the translation API. Set
`--stream-final-on-silence-ms 0` to disable auto-finalization (useful
when the wrapper finalizes on its own signal — e.g., a UI button —
instead of trailing silence).

`t0` / `t1` are wall-clock seconds since stream start, derived from
the cumulative sample count, so they map to the same timeline as the
input PCM. `t0` marks where the **utterance** started (first VAD
speech frame, or first non-empty model decode in no-VAD mode); `t1`
marks the last detected speech frame for `final` events, or the
current decoder-step time for `partial`.

### Finalization timing

Finalization fires when there has been **`--stream-final-on-silence-ms`
worth of trailing silence after the last detected speech**, not when
the entire rolling window has decoded to empty. With VAD enabled the
silence detector uses each VAD slice's end time directly; without VAD
the fallback is "the model decoded nothing for that long."

The practical effect: a speaker who pauses mid-paragraph for ~800 ms
gets a `final` per natural pause, instead of one giant final at the
end of the recording. Set `--stream-final-on-silence-ms` higher
(e.g. `2000`) if you want fewer finalizations / longer-form chunks.

### How `final.text` is built — `--stream-final-mode`

Two modes; `redecode` is the default.

```bash
# Best quality — re-runs the backend on the buffered utterance PCM at
# finalize time. final.text is guaranteed to cover [t0..t1] regardless
# of how the rolling window evicted audio.
crispasr --stream --stream-json --stream-final-mode redecode ...

# Cheaper — no extra encoder pass. final.text is built from a
# longest-common-prefix accumulator across consecutive partials, with
# the last partial appended. Subject to text duplication when the
# rolling window evicts mid-utterance audio.
crispasr --stream --stream-json --stream-final-mode prefix ...
```

In `redecode` mode CrispASR buffers the speech-region PCM in memory
(capped at `--stream-utterance-max-sec`, default `60` s — about 4 MB
at 16 kHz mono float). When the cap is hit the current utterance
auto-finalizes and the next speech opens a new utterance with a
fresh `utterance_id`. For most live-captioning / translation use
cases the redecode path is what you want — its output covers the
whole utterance the way `t0`/`t1` advertise.

`prefix` mode preserves round-1 cost (no extra `transcribe()` call)
at the price of imperfect text reconstruction on long utterances.
Useful when the encoder is large and the per-chunk budget is tight.

**Short-utterance fallback.** Backends that use convolutional
encoders (moonshine, parakeet, voxtral, …) abort with `OW > 0` from
`ggml_im2col` when handed audio shorter than the encoder's first conv
kernel — about 2 s at 16 kHz. When `redecode` would hit that limit
(the VAD-trimmed `[t0..t1]` is under 2 s) CrispASR skips the extra
backend pass and falls back to the **`prefix`-mode stitcher** for
that one finalize. `final.text` is then the LCP-accumulated prefix
plus the last partial — the same content the wrapper has already
seen in `partial` events, never an empty string blanking a
previously-emitted partial. The fallback is internal; no flag, no
event change.

## Microphone (`--mic`)

```bash
# Live microphone transcription (auto-detects arecord/sox/ffmpeg):
crispasr --mic -m model.gguf
```

CrispASR auto-detects whichever audio capture tool is on `$PATH`.

## Continuous live mode (`--live`)

```bash
# Continuous live mode (prints each chunk as a new line, never stops):
crispasr --live -m model.gguf

# With progress monitor symbols (▶ processing, ✓ got text, · silence):
crispasr --live --monitor -m model.gguf
```

`--live` runs indefinitely, emitting one transcript line per processed
chunk. `--monitor` adds visual feedback so you can tell processing
state at a glance.

## Per-token confidence

```bash
crispasr -m model.gguf -f audio.wav --alt
```

`--alt` prints alternative candidate tokens with probabilities — useful
for filtering low-confidence file transcriptions or for downstream
rescoring. Streaming modes do not currently emit this alternatives
block.

## Tuning the sliding window

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--stream-step N` | `3000` ms | Step between consecutive windows. Smaller = more frequent partial transcripts. |
| `--stream-length N` | `10000` ms | Rolling context window cap. The decode buffer accumulates audio up to this many ms, then drops the oldest samples from the front. Larger = better accuracy on long-form content but higher per-step cost. |
| `--stream-keep N` | `200` ms | Legacy — kept for compatibility, currently a no-op. The rolling buffer above subsumes it (see issue #84). |

> **Note (issue #84).** Before May 2026, `--stream-length` was a
> *ceiling* on `keep + step` rather than a true rolling cap, so
> `--stream-length 18000 --stream-keep 200 --stream-step 3000`
> actually decoded ~3.4 s of audio per step instead of 18 s. The
> streaming loop was rewritten to accumulate up to `length_samples`
> and drop the oldest frame on overflow, which matches the documented
> behaviour. `--stream-keep` is now informational only.

For native streaming-architecture backends (`voxtral4b`,
`moonshine-streaming`, `kyutai-stt`), the encoder runs incrementally —
the sliding window flags above still apply but the per-chunk cost is
lower than for batch backends.
