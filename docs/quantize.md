# Quantize

CrispASR ships a single, model-agnostic GGUF re-quantization tool,
**`crispasr-quantize`**, that works across all supported model
families: Whisper, Parakeet, Canary, Cohere, Voxtral, Qwen3, Granite,
Wav2Vec2, MiMo-ASR, GLM-ASR, Moonshine, VibeVoice, Kokoro, Qwen3-TTS,
and others. It iterates through the GGUF tensor list and re-quantizes
eligible 2D weight matrices while preserving metadata and
non-quantizable tensors (norms, positional embeddings, biases) in
their original types.

Replaces the legacy per-model tools (`cohere-quantize`,
`parakeet-quantize`, …) — those are no longer built. If a model card
references one of them, use `crispasr-quantize` instead with the same
arguments.

## Build

`crispasr-quantize` is built automatically as part of the default
build target. The shortest path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR
cd CrispASR
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

ls build/bin/crispasr-quantize    # confirm it exists
```

> If you previously built with `--target crispasr-lib` (which only builds
> the main library), re-run **without** `--target` or with
> `--target crispasr-quantize` to produce the quantize tool.

The `scripts/dev-build.sh` wrapper accepts `--target` directly:

```bash
scripts/dev-build.sh --target crispasr-quantize
```

> **glibc note.** Pre-built binaries on some HuggingFace model cards
> (e.g. `bin/cohere-quantize`) require glibc 2.38 and fail on Ubuntu
> 22.04 with:
> ```
> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.38' not found
> ```
> Building from source (above) avoids this — CrispASR has no glibc
> minimum of its own and builds cleanly against whatever glibc your
> distro ships.

## Usage

```bash
./build/bin/crispasr-quantize <input.gguf> <output.gguf> <type> \
    [--imatrix <file>] [--tensor-type <regex>=<type> ...]
```

`<type>` is one of the `ggml_ftype` names below.

`<input.gguf>` may be an **F16/F32 base OR an already-quantized GGUF**
(e.g. a shipped `q8_0`). A quantized input is dequantized to F32 and
then re-quantized to the target, so you can produce a `q4_k` / `iq4_xs`
build straight from a `q8_0` download without keeping the multi-GB F16
base on disk (q8_0 is ~lossless, so `q8→f32→q4 ≈ f32→q4`).

`--imatrix <file>` (optional) supplies an **importance matrix** — a
per-tensor, per-column activation-energy vector from a calibration
run — which steers k-quant / IQ-quant precision toward the columns the
model actually uses (activation-weighted error instead of plain L2,
the same idea as llama.cpp's `llama-imatrix`). It helps most for the
low-bit types (`iq4_*`, `q3_k`, `q2_k`); it is always safe to pass
(missing / shape-mismatched entries fall back to unweighted).

`--tensor-type <regex>=<type>` (optional, repeatable) overrides the
per-tensor precision for tensors whose name matches `<regex>`, on top of
the built-in per-architecture guards. First matching rule wins. `<type>`
may be `f16` / `f32` or any quant type below; a quant that doesn't tile a
tensor's row width falls back (or is skipped, with a note). The match is a
**partial** regex (llama.cpp semantics) — anchor with `^…$` for an exact
name. Examples:

```bash
# Keep the LM head at Q8_0 while the body is Q4_K, and pin FFN gates to Q6_K:
crispasr-quantize model-f16.gguf model.gguf q4_k \
    --tensor-type '^output\.weight$=q8_0' --tensor-type '\.ffn_gate\.=q6_k'
```

### Supported types

| Type   | Description                                                          |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `q4_0` | 4-bit (scale only)                                                   |
| `q4_1` | 4-bit (scale + minimum; slightly higher accuracy than q4_0)          |
| `q5_0` | 5-bit (scale only)                                                   |
| `q5_1` | 5-bit (scale + minimum; slightly higher accuracy than q5_0)          |
| `q8_0` | 8-bit (scale only) — usually indistinguishable from F16 quality      |
| `q2_k` | 2-bit K-quant (very lossy; use only when memory is critical)         |
| `q3_k` | 3-bit K-quant                                                        |
| `q4_k` | 4-bit K-quant (preferred over legacy q4_0/q4_1)                      |
| `q5_k` | 5-bit K-quant (preferred over legacy q5_0/q5_1)                      |
| `q6_k` | 6-bit K-quant (close to F16 quality, 60% of F16 size)                |
| `iq4_nl` | 4-bit non-linear codebook (32-wide blocks)                         |
| `iq4_xs` | 4-bit non-linear codebook (256-wide super-blocks) — beats `q4_k` on quality *and* size for the same ~4-bit budget; pair with `--imatrix` |

### Examples

```bash
# Whisper base.en F16 → Q4_K (small + fast)
./build/bin/crispasr-quantize ggml-base.en.bin ggml-base.en-q4_k.bin q4_k

# Parakeet TDT 0.6B F16 → Q4_K
./build/bin/crispasr-quantize parakeet-tdt-0.6b-f16.gguf parakeet-tdt-0.6b-q4_k.gguf q4_k

# Voxtral Mini 4B F16 → Q5_0
./build/bin/crispasr-quantize voxtral-mini-4b-realtime-f16.gguf \
                              voxtral-mini-4b-realtime-q5_0.gguf q5_0

# Canary 1B F16 → Q6_K (near-lossless)
./build/bin/crispasr-quantize canary-1b-v2-f16.gguf canary-1b-v2-q6_k.gguf q6_k

# Re-quantize straight from a shipped q8_0 (no F16 base needed) → IQ4_XS
./build/bin/crispasr-quantize mega-asr-1.7b-q8_0.gguf mega-asr-1.7b-iq4_xs.gguf iq4_xs

# IQ4_XS with an importance matrix for best low-bit quality
./build/bin/crispasr-quantize model-f16.gguf model-iq4_xs.gguf iq4_xs --imatrix model.imatrix.gguf
```

### Alignment fallback

K-quants (`q2_k` through `q6_k`) and `iq4_xs` require tensor row sizes
to be multiples of 256. If a tensor doesn't meet this requirement (e.g.
the 896-wide tensors in some Qwen3-ASR layers), the tool transparently
falls back to a compatible smaller-block quant for that tensor only
(`q4_k`→`q4_0`, `q5_k`→`q5_0`, `q6_k`→`q8_0`, `iq4_xs`→`iq4_nl`→`q4_0`),
and the rest of the model still gets the requested type. The output
GGUF is always fully quantized — there is no half-quantized failure
mode.

### Generating an importance matrix (calibration)

An importance matrix records, per weight and per input column, how much
activation energy the model actually put through that column on a
representative corpus. Feeding it to the quantizer (`--imatrix`) lets
k-quant / IQ-quant spend its bits where they matter, which recovers
quality at low bit-widths (`iq4_*`, `q3_k`, `q2_k`).

CrispASR produces the imatrix as a **side effect of normal
transcription**. Set `CRISPASR_IMATRIX_OUT` and run the model over your
calibration audio; every run **merges into** the same file, so you can
stream a corpus across many invocations:

```bash
export CRISPASR_IMATRIX_OUT=mega-asr.imatrix.gguf
for f in calib/*.wav; do
    ./build/bin/crispasr -m mega-asr-1.7b-q8_0.gguf -f "$f"
done
# → "imatrix: wrote N tensors to 'mega-asr.imatrix.gguf'" after each run

# Then quantize with it:
./build/bin/crispasr-quantize mega-asr-1.7b-q8_0.gguf \
    mega-asr-1.7b-iq4_xs.gguf iq4_xs --imatrix mega-asr.imatrix.gguf
```

A small **CC0** starter corpus (Common Voice EN + DE) lives at
[`cstr/crispasr-imatrix-calib`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cstr/crispasr-imatrix-calib)
(see [`tools/imatrix-calib/`](../tools/imatrix-calib/)). The A/B harness
[`tools/imatrix_ab.py`](../tools/imatrix_ab.py) measures the effect
(prefill-logit cosine + transcript CER vs the f16 gold).

Notes:

- **No-op unless the env var is set** — production paths are unaffected.
- Collection copies each `mul_mat` activation to host, so a calibration
  run is slower than a normal transcription; that cost is only paid when
  `CRISPASR_IMATRIX_OUT` is set.
- Calibrate on **in-distribution audio** (the languages / domain you
  care about), not a single clip — the matrix is only as good as the
  corpus that produced it. Measured on qwen3-asr-0.6b q4_k: an EN+DE
  Common Voice set lifted cosine-to-f16 **0.890 → 0.941**, while an
  English-only set **regressed** it. Language/domain coverage is decisive.
- **imatrix helps most at aggressive bit-widths.** On qwen3-asr-0.6b
  **q3_k**, imatrix roughly *thirded* the transcript error vs f16
  (CER **0.37 → 0.13**, 6/12 held-out clips improved). Note the two A/B
  signals can diverge there: the prefill-logit **cosine** dipped
  (−0.04) even as **CER** — the real quality metric — improved sharply.
  Trust CER; the single-position cosine is only a proxy.
- Implemented for the ASR backends whose large weights actually benefit
  (whisper, parakeet, canary, cohere, qwen3-asr / mega-asr, higgs-stt,
  ark-asr, moss-transcribe, granite, glm-asr, mimo-asr, voxtral). The
  collector is installed on the decode scheduler
  (`crispasr_imatrix_install`); adding it to another backend is a
  one-line call after its `ggml_backend_sched_new`.

## Recommended quants per backend

These reflect the trade-offs we measured on the regression suite. F16
is always the reference; Q4_K is the daily-driver default for most
ASR backends.
