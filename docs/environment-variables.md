# Environment variables

CrispASR exposes a large number of environment variables — tuning knobs, device
placement overrides, benchmark timers, and debug/dump switches. This page is the
single reference for all of them: the naming convention, the cross-cutting
variables, the per-backend variables, and the ones CrispASR deliberately does
**not** own.

> This document was introduced for issue #265 ("consistency and documentation").
> The same change standardized every backend-owned variable onto one prefix and
> unified the reference-voice cache location (see below).

## Naming convention

Every CrispASR-owned variable is named:

```
CRISPASR_<BACKEND>_<FEATURE>
```

for example `CRISPASR_OMNIVOICE_CODEC_GPU`, `CRISPASR_IRODORI_CODEC_GPU`,
`CRISPASR_PARAKEET_BENCH`. Process-global variables that are not tied to one
backend drop the `<BACKEND>` segment (`CRISPASR_MODELS_DIR`, `CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU`).

### Legacy aliases and deprecation warnings

Historically many backends used a bare prefix (`OMNIVOICE_CODEC_GPU`,
`QWEN3_TTS_BENCH`, `CHATTERBOX_DEBUG`, …). Those bare names **still work** as
legacy aliases so existing scripts, notebooks, and Kaggle A/B kernels keep
running. The alias is derived automatically by stripping the `CRISPASR_` prefix,
so for any `CRISPASR_FOO_BAR` documented here the bare `FOO_BAR` is also honored.

The first time a run reads a value from a **legacy** name, CrispASR prints a
one-time notice to stderr:

```
[crispasr] warning: environment variable 'OMNIVOICE_CODEC_GPU' is deprecated and
will be removed in a future release; use 'CRISPASR_OMNIVOICE_CODEC_GPU' instead
(the old name still works for now). ...
```

Migrate to the canonical `CRISPASR_`-prefixed name at your convenience. To
silence the warnings (e.g. for a pipeline that scrapes stderr and cannot migrate
yet), set:

```
CRISPASR_SUPPRESS_ENV_DEPRECATION=1
```

The lookup + aliasing is implemented once in `src/core/crispasr_env.h`
(`crispasr_env::get / truthy / present`); new backends should read env vars
through that helper with a canonical `CRISPASR_`-prefixed name.

### Value/truthiness conventions

Most variables are read with one of two conventions — check the surrounding
suffix legend, but as a rule:

- **Flag (opt-in)** — set to `1` (or any non-empty, non-`0` value) to enable.
  Some legacy flags treat *being set at all* as on, so prefer `=1` / unset it
  entirely rather than `=0` when a flag's exact semantics matter.
- **Path / value** — the variable's value is a filesystem path, integer, or
  float used directly.

### Common suffix legend

The same feature suffixes recur across nearly every backend. Rather than repeat
them per backend below, they mean:

| Suffix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `_BENCH` | Print per-stage wall-clock timings for that engine. |
| `_DEBUG` / `_DIAG` | Verbose debug logging. |
| `_DUMP_DIR` / `_DUMP` / `_DUMP_*` | Write intermediate tensors / stages to disk (diagnostics, diff-harness). |
| `_FORCE_SCALAR` | Disable SIMD kernels (numeric-parity debugging). |
| `_GPU` / `_USE_GPU` / `_FORCE_METAL` | Force that stage/codec onto the GPU. |
| `_CPU` / `_CPU_ONLY` / `_FORCE_CPU` | Force that stage/codec onto the CPU. |
| `_NO_FA` / `_FLASH_ATTN` | Toggle flash-attention. |
| `_FASTCONV` (`_DEBUG`) | Enable the baked-F32 / matmul conv fast path for a codec/vocoder. |
| `_CFG_INTERVAL` (`_DEBUG`) | Interval-CFG cadence for a flow-matching decoder. |
| `_SEED` | RNG seed for reproducible generation. |
| `_*_FILE` / `_*_PATH` / `_*_GGUF` | Override an asset/model/fixture path (mostly dev/test). |

## Global / cross-cutting variables

These are not tied to a single backend.

### Paths, cache, and models

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_MODELS_DIR` | Directory searched for GGUF models (also the auto-download target root). |
| `CRISPASR_CACHE_DIR` | Base cache directory for auto-downloaded models/assets. Resolution order is `CRISPASR_CACHE_DIR` → `CRISPASR_MODELS_DIR` → platform default (`$HOME/.cache/crispasr`; `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\crispasr` on Windows). |
| `CRISPASR_SCRATCH_DIR` | Scratch directory for temporary run artifacts. |
| `CRISPASR_DUMP_DIR` | Global tensor-dump directory (diagnostics). |
| `CRISPASR_GGUF_MMAP` / `CRISPASR_GGUF_PRELOAD` | Control GGUF mmap vs. preload-into-RAM loading. |
| `CRISPASR_GGUF_MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK` | Lower the per-buffer allocation cap in bytes (default 1.5 GiB) used to split a model across several backend buffers on drivers with a small `maxMemoryAllocationSize` (#276). |
| `CRISPASR_MLOCK` | mlock model weights into RAM. |
| `CRISPASR_IGNORE_CPU_ISA` | `=1` exactly (no other value works) continues past the startup build-vs-host CPU instruction-set check (#380) instead of exiting; the process will SIGILL at the first compute op the CPU can't run. |

### GPU / device placement

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_N_GPU_LAYERS` | Number of transformer layers to offload to the GPU. |
| `CRISPASR_ARG_DEVICE` | Default device selection for the CLI. |
| `CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU` | Keep the KV cache on the CPU. |
| `CRISPASR_KV_QUANT` / `_KV_QUANT_K` / `_KV_QUANT_V` / `_KV_READ_F32` | KV-cache quantization / read format. |
| `CRISPASR_GPU_PREF_CPU_LEGACY` | `1` restores the pre-T18 behaviour where `--gpu-backend cpu` fell through to the best GPU. Off by default: the fall-through silently constructed a Metal device the flag exists to avoid. |
| `CRISPASR_METAL_PIPELINE_CACHE_MAX_MB` | Size cap in MiB (default `64`) above which the on-disk Metal pipeline-cache archive is skipped at init — opening it costs ~1 ms/MB. `0` = uncapped (always use it). macOS only. |

> Device *selection* across compiled backends also honors the standard ggml /
> CUDA variables `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and `GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES` — see
> "Variables CrispASR does not own" below.

### Session / long-audio chunking

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_SESSION_AUTOCHUNK` | Enable auto-chunking in the session API for long audio. |
| `CRISPASR_SESSION_CHUNK_SECONDS` | Chunk length (seconds) for session auto-chunking. |
| `CRISPASR_SESSION_PERBACKEND_CHUNK` | Use per-backend chunk-window tuning instead of a flat window. |
| `CRISPASR_SESSION_UNIFIED_DISPATCH` | Route surfaces through the unified library dispatch path. |
| `CRISPASR_SLICE_PIPELINE` | Force the CLI's encode ∥ decode slice pipeline on/off. The override may only turn it OFF, or ON where it is *already* safe — it can never switch off one of the safety conditions (`-p N`, `--return-logits`, gap-fill re-entry, single slice). |

### Post-decode hygiene (PLAN.md §W2–W7)

All OFF unless set. Each of these can delete or alter user-visible text, so
none of them switches on by surprise; a wrong deletion is worse than a
surviving artifact. Applied on both the CLI and the session C-ABI.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MAX_CHARS` | Truncate any segment longer than N **code points**, backing up to the last `。．.！!？?、,` but never below 75% of the cap. A line past the cap is almost always a repetition hallucination that survived the n-gram collapse. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_DROP_NONVERBAL` | Drop segments that are entirely a non-verbal marker — `[Music]`, `(applause)`, `（喘ぎ声）`, `♪`. Running speech merely *containing* such a word is never dropped. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_LOGPROB_THOLD` | Drop segments whose average log-probability is below this. Post-hoc, on top of the decoder's own fallback gate. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_LOGPROB_MARGIN` | Loosen that threshold by this much for segments ≤1.6 s — a short segment's mean logprob is noisier, so it gets more room, not less. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MERGE_REPEATS` | Collapse runs of near-identical adjacent segments into one spanning the whole run. Catches a phrase repeating *across* segment boundaries, which per-segment loop fixes cannot see. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MERGE_SIMILARITY` | Similarity bar for the above (default 0.90; LCS over code points). |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MERGE_GAP_CS` | Never merge across a gap wider than this many centiseconds (default 200). Two identical lines a minute apart are two real utterances. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MERGE_MIN_RUN` | Minimum consecutive similar segments before merging (default 3), so an ordinary repeated "yes." pair survives. |

### Alignment and VAD sanity checks

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_ALIGN_SENTINEL` | `0` disables the forced-alignment collapse check. On by default, **detect + warn only**. Catches `ctc_forced_align()` returning words at `t0 == t1 == 0` — its two silent-zero paths (characters absent from the CTC vocab, or a word the Viterbi path never visited) produce garbage timestamps inside a *successful* return. |
| `CRISPASR_ALIGN_SENTINEL_REDISTRIBUTE` | `1` opts into repair: respace the words across the clip in proportion to character count. Off by default — a wrong auto-repair would be just as invisible as the collapse. |
| `CRISPASR_VAD_FAILOVER` | `0` disables the VAD sanity check. On by default: if a clip over 120 s comes back with under 1% speech coverage (or a couple of segments covering under 10% of a very long clip), the VAD is wrong and the run falls back to fixed full-clip chunks rather than losing the transcript. |
| `CRISPASR_NGRAM_LOOPFIX_OFF` | `1` disables the repeated-n-gram collapse entirely, exposing the RAW decoded text. Diagnostic: for telling whether a loop originates in the decode itself or is merely being masked. |
| `CRISPASR_ORDER_WARN` | `0` disables the one-shot "segment timestamps go backwards" warning. On by default; detect + warn only. Cues that merely *overlap* are deliberately not flagged (gap-fill jitter). |
| `CRISPASR_ALIGN_NO_ROMANIZE` | `1` passes non-Latin reference text through raw instead of auto-romanizing it for a CTC aligner with a Latin vocabulary (#252). |
| `CRISPASR_ALIGN_DEBUG` | `1` prints the romanized reference transcript the aligner actually used. |

### Decoding / beam search (shared)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_MAES_BETA` / `_MAES_GAMMA` / `_MAES_NUM_STEPS` | MAES beam-search parameters. |
| `CRISPASR_TDT_BATCH` / `CRISPASR_RNNT_BATCH` | Batch the TDT / RNNT joint decode. |
| `CRISPASR_RNNT_GGML_PERSTEP` | Per-step (vs. persistent-graph) ggml RNNT decode. |
| `CRISPASR_NGRAM_LOOPFIX_OFF` | Disable the n-gram decode-loop breaker. |
| `CRISPASR_GAP_FILL` / `_GAP_FILL_MIN_CS` | Re-transcribe spans a first pass left empty (long audio); on by default for parakeet, threshold non-JA 300 cs / JA 100 cs. |

### G2P / phonemizer

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_CMUDICT_PATH` | Path to the CMUdict pronunciation dictionary. |
| `CRISPASR_DE_DICT_PATH` / `_FR_DICT_PATH` / `_ES_DICT_PATH` | Language-specific pronunciation dictionaries. |
| `CRISPASR_G2P_DICT_SOURCE` / `_G2P_MODEL_PATH` | G2P dictionary source / neural G2P model path. |
| `CRISPASR_ESPEAK_DATA_PATH` | eSpeak-NG data directory. |
| `CRISPASR_MISAKI_DICT_PATH` | Path to the misaki US contextual-word dictionary (default `~/.cache/crispasr/misaki-us.txt`) used by the English misaki G2P (#316). |
| `CRISPASR_KOKORO_G2P` | Kokoro G2P backend selection. |
| `CRISPASR_KOKORO_MISAKI_IPA` | `0` disables the espeak-IPA → misaki-alphabet conversion Kokoro needs (#316), restoring the raw G2P spelling for A/B. On by default. |
| `CRISPASR_G2P_DE_UNSTRESS` | `1` reads the German closed class the way espeak reads it in a SENTENCE (`sie` → `ziː`) instead of the citation form our per-word dictionary stores (`zˈiː`). Off by default: it takes phoneme agreement with espeak from 45.9% to 87.1%, but the ASR round-trip could not resolve a difference, and that metric measures intelligibility rather than naturalness (#316). |
| `CRISPASR_KOKORO_DE_MISAKI_ALPHABET` | `1` applies misaki's tied-sequence collapse for German (`tsvˈaɪ` → `ʦvˈI`), which is what the published training recipe does. Off by default: it made the ASR round-trip worse on the `kokoro-de-hui-base` model we ship, which appears to predate that part of the recipe (#316). The `ʏ`→`y` vocabulary fixup is applied either way. |
| `CRISPASR_T5_REPEAT_BREAK` | `0` disables the decode-loop break for madlad/T5 translation, restoring exact PyTorch-blueprint behaviour. On by default: MADLAD greedy-decodes into a repeated token cycle on some short inputs and burns the whole token budget on it. The blueprint does the same — this is a deliberate improvement on it, not a parity fix (#333). |
| `CRISPASR_T5_NO_KV_REUSE` | `1` re-forwards the whole decoder prefix each step instead of appending to the KV cache. Same output, much slower; an A/B lever for isolating cache bugs (#333). |
| `CRISPASR_T5_KEEP_EMBED` | `1` keeps `shared.embed.*` and `lm_head.*` at source precision when quantizing a T5 model. **Off by default because it was measured and loses**: on madlad400 it makes q8_0 3.38→3.62 GB and q4_k 2.04→2.41 GB for a worst-stage cosine that does not improve (0.999922→0.999920, 0.992929→0.992606). The Q4_K loss accumulates through the 32 encoder blocks, not in the embedding lookup (#333). |
| `CRISPASR_KOKORO_PUNCT` | `0` drops punctuation from the phoneme string for the German/French/Spanish built-in G2Ps, restoring pre-0.8.26 behaviour for A/B. On by default: Kokoro's vocabulary contains `,.;:!?` and they are how it pauses (#316). English is not gated — it is settled against misaki. |

### Watermark / provenance

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_NO_WATERMARK` | Disable the audio watermark. |
| `CRISPASR_WATERMARK_LEGACY` | Use the legacy watermark path. |
| `CRISPASR_WATERMARK_DETECT` | Which statistic `--detect-watermark` uses: `frames` (per-frame *t* + decoy specificity) or `sign` / `0` (the older averaged-spectrum sign test, kept for A/B and for re-reading an older release's score). |
| `CRISPASR_NO_C2PA_REMUX` | Skip the C2PA MP4 remux step. |
| `CRISPASR_CONSENT_LOG` | Path to a JSON-Lines sink for voice-cloning consent records. Without it the records only go to stderr, which is interleaved with model-load noise and so a poor evidential artefact. |

### Quantization / diff-harness / misc

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_QUANT_LMHEAD` | Quantize the LM head during `crispasr-quantize`. |
| `CRISPASR_IMATRIX_OUT` | Importance-matrix output path. |
| `CRISPASR_ACTDUMP_OUT` / `_ACTDUMP_TENSOR` | Activation dump output / target tensor. |
| `CRISPASR_DIFF_NO_GPU` / `_DIFF_USE_GPU` / `_DIFF_SLICES` / `_DIFF_STAGES` | `crispasr-diff` harness controls. |
| `CRISPASR_MEL_SERIAL` | Force the serial STFT. The parallel mel/STFT path is DEFAULT ON since #305; this is the opt-out. (The older opt-in `CRISPASR_MEL_PARALLEL` is no longer read.) |
| `CRISPASR_MEL_TIMING` | Print mel/STFT stage timings. |
| `CRISPASR_HQ_RESAMPLE` | `0` selects the cheap linear resampler for CLI input decoding instead of the high-quality one. |
| `CRISPASR_CORE_ATTN_EAGER_F32` | Force the shared attention helper's eager (non-flash) path to F32 accumulation. |
| `CRISPASR_CORE_ATTN_DUMP_FA_LAYER` | Dump the shared attention helper's flash-attn inputs/outputs for one layer index. |
| `CRISPASR_VERBOSE` | Global verbose output. |
| `CRISPASR_NO_WARMUP` / `CRISPASR_WARMUP` | Skip / force the model warmup pass. |
| `CRISPASR_SERVER_WORKERS` / `CRISPASR_API_KEYS` | HTTP server worker count / API keys. |
| `CRISPASR_TEST_STREAM_THROW` | Test-only: lets the server's streaming worker throw on the magic input `__throw_test__` (both the variable *and* the input are required, so it cannot fire in production). |

### Container / launcher

Read by the Docker images and `.devops/run-server.sh`, not by the C++ itself —
`crispasr-diagnostics` echoes them so a support dump shows how the container was
started.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_BACKEND` | Backend the container's entrypoint should select (`docker-compose*.yml`, `.env.example`). |
| `CRISPASR_USE_CUDA_COMPAT` | `1` prepends `/usr/local/cuda/compat` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the CUDA images — for hosts whose driver is older than the image's CUDA runtime. |

### Vendored ggml (CrispASR-added)

CrispASR's in-tree `ggml/` carries a few CrispASR-prefixed knobs on top of
upstream's `GGML_*` set. They are read by `getenv` directly (no legacy alias).

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_GGML_ALLOC_TRACE` | Trace `ggml-alloc` graph-allocation decisions. |
| `CRISPASR_GGML_ALLOC_TRACE_MAX_PASSES` | Number of allocation passes that trace prints (default: unlimited once the trace is on). |
| `CRISPASR_METAL_N_CB` | Override the Metal backend's command-buffer count (#83). |
| `CRISPASR_METAL_PROFILE` | `1` whole-graph host/GPU split, `2` per-op breakdown, `3` per-op plus a per-node trace announced *before* each encode — with `3` the last line names the node an encode faulted on. |
| `CRISPASR_METAL_STRICT_FP` | Compile the Metal kernels with fast-math OFF (#83). Costs throughput; buys bit-identical CPU/GPU output where operand reordering was downconverting F32 intermediates. |
| `CRISPASR_METAL_FORCE_BARRIER` | `1` forces a memory barrier before every Metal op (concurrency-hazard bisection, #83). |
| `CRISPASR_METAL_IM2COL_FLAT` | `0` restores the legacy IM2COL Metal kernel. The flat kernel (one thread per dst element) is the default. |
| `CRISPASR_FORCE_BLIT_COPY` | Use the blit-encoder copy path even for a shared (unified-memory) Metal buffer (#83). |
| `CRISPASR_FORCE_DMB` | Insert a full memory barrier after the host memcpy into a shared Metal buffer (#83). |

## Reference-voice cache (voice cloning)

Encoding a reference clip for voice cloning (a codec encoder, a Conformer /
Perceiver, or an ASR pass) is slow and produces a small, reusable blob. Every
voice-cloning TTS backend caches that blob through **one shared mechanism**
(`src/core/tts_ref_cache.h`), so the location and disable switch are identical
across backends (issue #265 unified OmniVoice — which previously used a bespoke
`~/.cache/crispasr` cache — onto this path):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_TTS_REF_CACHE` | Set to `0` to disable reference-voice caching everywhere. |
| `CRISPASR_TTS_REF_CACHE_DIR` | Override the cache directory (default `<TMPDIR>/crispasr-tts-refcache`). |

Content-addressed entries are keyed by a hash of the raw reference (plus, for
some backends, an encoder-weight fingerprint) and tagged per backend
(`irodori-latent`, `openvoice2-se`, `omnivoice-voice`, `f5-reftext`, …) so no two
backends read each other's blob. OmniVoice additionally honors the legacy
`CRISPASR_OMNIVOICE_VOICE_CACHE=0` as an alias for the shared disable switch.

## Variables CrispASR does not own

These are read by CrispASR but are **OS / third-party conventions** and are
intentionally *not* renamed to the `CRISPASR_` prefix:

| Variable | Origin |
|----------|--------|
| `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | OS home / cache dirs. |
| `TMPDIR`, `TEMP`, `TMP` | OS temp dir (also the default ref-cache root). |
| `HF_TOKEN`, `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` | HuggingFace auth (Hub convention). |
| `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | CUDA device selection. |
| `GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | ggml Vulkan device selection. |
| `LLAMA_*` | Vendored `llama.cpp` (talk-llama example). |

### Sibling modular libraries (own conventions)

The in-tree modular libraries keep their own established prefixes and are synced
from their sibling repos, so their variables are **not** part of the `CRISPASR_`
scheme:

- **`crisp_audio/`** — audio tower: `CRISP_AUDIO_DUMP_STAGES`, `CRISP_AUDIO_KEEP_PAD_FRAMES`, `CRISP_AUDIO_WINDOWED_ATTN`.
- **`glint/`** — clean-room MP3/AAC codec: `GLINT_*`, `AACDBG`.
- **`crisp_lid/` · `crisp_punc/` · `crisp_truecase/`** — standalone LID / punctuation / truecasing libraries; they and their `src/` counterparts follow each library's own naming (`LID_*`, `FIREREDPUNC_*`, `PCS_*`, `TRUECASER_*`). `FIREREDPUNC_DEBUG=1` prints each restore pass as `[PUNCDBG] in=<…>` / `out=<…>`, which is the quickest way to see a backend's *true* model output — `--no-punctuation` is not, because it strips punctuation after the fact and so hides text the model punctuated itself.
  > ⚠ **These libraries are built by the main target, and each has a second copy under `src/`.** `src/CMakeLists.txt` prefers `crisp_punc/` (etc.) and falls back to the `src/` copy only when the sibling directory is missing from a checkout — so the `crisp_punc/` copy is what normally links, and **a change must be applied to both**. #308's capitalisation fix went into `src/fireredpunc.cpp` alone and was dead code for months while the shipping copy kept the bug. `tests/test-punc-copies-in-sync.cpp` now fails if they diverge.

## Test fixtures

The live/integration test suite reads a few `CRISPASR_`-prefixed fixture
variables (model/audio paths); `tests/env-live-tests.sh` sets sensible defaults.
Like every other variable here, the pre-standardization bare names are still
honored as deprecated aliases:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_PARAFORMER_MODEL` / `_PARAFORMER_MODEL_Q4K` / `_PARAFORMER_AUDIO_ZH` / `_PARAFORMER_AUDIO_EN` | Paraformer test model / audio paths. |
| `CRISPASR_AUDIOSEAL_GGUF` | AudioSeal test model path. |
| `CRISPASR_PIPER_TEST_MODEL` | Piper phonemize test model path. |
| `CRISPASR_OV2_DUMP_DIR` | OpenVoice2 HiFi test dump directory. |
| `CRISPASR_MODEL_BTC_CHORDS` | BTC chord-recognition test model path. Defaults to `$CRISPASR_MODELS_DIR/btc-chords-large-f32.gguf`. |

---

# Per-backend variables

Every variable below is the canonical `CRISPASR_`-prefixed name; the bare form
(without `CRISPASR_`) is accepted as a deprecated alias. See the **suffix
legend** above for the meaning of the common `_BENCH` / `_DEBUG` / `_DUMP_*` /
`_GPU` / `_CPU` / `_FORCE_SCALAR` / `_FASTCONV` / `_CFG_INTERVAL` / `_SEED`
suffixes.

### AAC codec

### BERT encoder

- `CRISPASR_BERT_ENCODER_BENCH`

### BTC chord recognition

- `CRISPASR_BTC_DEBUG`
- `CRISPASR_BTC_DUMP_FEAT`
- `CRISPASR_BTC_MAJ_MIN` — collapse the 170-class chord output to the 25-class
  maj/min vocabulary. Default off (full 170-class output): 170 reduces to
  maj/min at runtime, but a 25-class model can never be expanded, so the
  170-class checkpoint is the shipping default.

> The shipped BTC weights are **CC-BY-NC-SA** (trained on Isophonics / Robbie
> Williams / UsPop2002 chord annotations) even though the upstream BTC code and
> CrispASR itself are MIT. The registry refuses to download them without
> `--accept-license cc-by-nc-sa-4.0` (or `CRISPASR_ACCEPT_LICENSE`). A
> commercial product must supply its own weights.

### HTDemucs (source separation)

- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_BLAS` — route the CrossTransformer matmuls through
  `cblas_sgemm` (default **ON** where Accelerate is available). `=0` selects the
  scalar path. The transformer is ~86% of an unoptimised forward pass, so this is
  the dominant knob (measured 44x on the transformer, 4.6x overall).
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_FASTCONV` — batched im2col + one GEMM for the CPU convs
  (default **ON**). `=0` selects the original per-time-frame scalar path.
  Measured `enc.conv2d` 10.0 s -> 0.17 s and `enc.rewrite` 12.2 s -> 0.30 s.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_WCACHE` — cache F32 copies of weight tensors by pointer
  (default **ON**). `=0` re-reads and re-converts on every access, which the
  DConv stacks do ~6k times per encoder layer.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_GGML` — run the CrossTransformer as a ggml graph instead of
  the CPU/BLAS path (default **OFF**). Verified correct on CPU and Metal (45/45
  stages, every layer cos 1.000000) but not yet proven faster overall, so it
  stays opt-in per the inverse-default rule.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_GPU` — request a GPU backend (CUDA > Metal > Vulkan, CPU
  fallback). Only meaningful together with `_GGML=1`: under the CPU/BLAS path
  the weights would sit on the device and every kernel would pay a read back.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_NO_BCAST_CAST` — disable the issue-#398 fix that casts
  non-F32 affine/bias weights to F32 in-graph before broadcast add/mul sites
  (bisection aid). With `=1` the pre-fix graph is rebuilt, which on CUDA
  aborts in `binbcast.cu` (`nb10 % sizeof(src1_t)`) because the F16 GGUF
  stores the DConv GroupNorm affines (`*.dconv.layers.N.4.weight`) as F16.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_PROFILE` — print a per-phase wall-time breakdown of one
  forward pass (stft / enc / transformer / dec / istft).
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_DEBUG` — verbose per-layer shape and NaN diagnostics.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_SKIP_TIME` — skip the time branch (bisection aid).
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_FUSED` — per-layer fused ggml graphs (default **OFF**): the
  host↔device roundtrip per layer measured slower than CPU+Accelerate for the
  encoder, even though the transformer alone is 3.3–6x faster.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_MEMSTATS` — log each weight-cache admission and the running
  cache total in MB.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_NO_SEGMENT` — process the whole track in one pass instead of
  the 25%-overlap segment schedule (A/B against the old behaviour).

All three optimisation gates are output-equivalent: the per-stage diff reports
45/45 stages passing with them ON or OFF.

### Diarization — foxnose (#324)

- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_COUNT` — speaker-count estimator: `bic` (default, the
  upstream GMM/BIC + silhouette sweep) or `eigengap`. Eigengap is better on
  well-separated synthetic data and cheaper, but under-counts on real speech
  (11.4 % vs 5.3 % DER on VoxConverse) — see `docs/foxnose-diarize/PLAN.md`
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_BIC_WINDOW` — score silhouette only in a `[k-2, k+3]` window
  around the BIC anchor instead of the full `[min, max]` range. The full range is
  the default: the BIC anchor is unreliable in both directions (measured errors
  of +5 / -3 / -3 on 4/5/6 well-separated blobs) and when it over-counts the
  window is stranded above the truth and cannot climb back to it
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_BENCH` — per-stage embedder timings (fbank / resnet /
  resnet_windows). Counting invocations of these is also how you check WHICH
  embedding path actually ran
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_DEBUG` — embedder diagnostics
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_DEBUG` — chosen speaker count, the reason it was chosen,
  and the per-k silhouette curve behind it. Worth reading before trusting a
  count: on a borderline file the decision can rest on a <1 % score gap
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_EMBED_WORKERS` — windows embedded concurrently (default:
  `-t`). Each worker gets its own context sharing one copy of the weights
- `CRISPASR_SPEAKER_EMBED_WORKERS` — the same worker count for the standalone
  `crispasr-diarize` CLI's speaker-embedding stage
- `CRISPASR_SPEAKER_EMBED_THREADS` — ggml threads per embedder context
  (default: `-t`). Honoured by the pluggable embedders and by wespeaker
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_SPAN_EMBED=1` — run ONE network pass per span of windows
  instead of one per window. 1.78x less diarization CPU for +0.30 mean DER on
  the VoxConverse dev shard; off by default because accuracy is the better
  default for a diarizer. See `docs/cli.md#diarization`
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_SPAN_WINDOWS` — windows per span (default 32). Measured NOT
  to affect the accuracy cost — identical from N=2 to N=32 — so there is
  nothing to tune here; larger is simply faster
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_CONV` — conv lowering for the WeSpeaker embedder:
  `im2col` (default) lowers each conv to explicit IM2COL + MUL_MAT nodes so
  the GEMMs reach the Accelerate BLAS backend on CPU and the simdgroup
  mul_mm kernels on Metal; `direct` restores GGML_OP_CONV_2D. Measured on
  esrit.wav (215 s, `-t 8`): diarization delta 9.8 s -> 5.9 s (~1.6x),
  embeddings cosine 1.0 vs direct, DER identical per file (7.32 % shard mean)
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_GPU=1` — run the WeSpeaker embedder on the GPU backend
  (single context; the CPU worker pool is stood down because workers borrow
  weights that now live in a GPU buffer). With the im2col default and batched
  windows Metal reaches parity with the 8-worker CPU schedule on an M-series
  (8.5 s vs 8.7 s wall on esrit.wav) but does not beat it, so CPU stays the
  default; the switch exists for machines where the GPU/CPU balance differs
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_BATCH_EMBED` — batch independent 1.2 s windows into one
  graph along ne[3] (arithmetic-identical to per-window; cosine 1.0). Default:
  ON under `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_GPU=1` (collapses ~350 Metal dispatches into
  ~11 and is what got Metal from a 2x loss to parity), OFF on CPU (measured
  12.1 -> 14.9 s wall on esrit.wav: ggml's CPU conv loops ne[3], so fusing
  buys no GEMM shape and the 32-window chunks starve the worker schedule).
  `1`/`0` forces either way
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_BATCH` — max windows per batched graph (default 32 on
  GPU, 16 on CPU; cap 32). Only meaningful where the batch path is active

### GigaAM-v3

- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_BENCH` — per-stage timings (mel / encoder / decode)
- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_DEBUG` — encoder output min/max/mean
- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_FLASH` — `ggml_flash_attn_ext` in the encoder (opt-in; the
  manual QK^T path is what the per-stage diff was validated on)
- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_FORCE_SCALAR` — scalar LSTM/joint loops instead of cblas
- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_QUANT_ALL` — let `crispasr-quantize` quantize the heads and
  the pre-encode convs too (default keeps them at source precision)

  from the text being spoken and use it if it maps to an id the model knows.
  An explicitly requested language always wins; a low-confidence guess resolves
  to nothing and behaves exactly as before. `=0` restores the old
  always-language-agnostic behaviour. Exists because SubtitleEdit's language
  menu is not yet wired to its request payload (#13273).

- `CRISPASR_PYANNOTE_SEG_BENCH`
- `CRISPASR_PYANNOTE_SEG_DUMP`
- `CRISPASR_PYANNOTE_CHUNK_S` — audio per chunk of parallel inference, in
  seconds (default 60; `0` restores the pre-#326 single scan over the whole
  file). Chunking is decided by audio LENGTH and never by thread count, so
  posteriors do not change with `-t`
- `CRISPASR_PYANNOTE_CHUNK_CONTEXT_S` — real audio spliced either side of a
  chunk and then trimmed (default 5), which absorbs the convolutions' zero
  padding and the LSTM's zero initial state

  logits (f32, before the repetition penalty and the suppress mask) plus a
  top-5 line to stderr. The instrument for a cross-backend diff: tokens
  alone cannot tell a miscompute from amplified rounding (#337).
- `CRISPASR_QWEN3_TTS_REPLAY_CODES=<file>` — 16 whitespace-separated codec ids
  per frame; the decode uses them instead of sampling. Teacher forcing, and
  the ONLY way to compare two backends step by step: pin the whole frame or
  the 15 residual codebooks (which must be sampled) diverge and the diff
  measures trajectory, not arithmetic (#337).
- `CRISPASR_QWEN3_TTS_REPLAY_TOKENS=<file>` — the weaker form: codebook-0 ids
  only. Useful for forcing a trajectory, NOT sufficient for a logits diff.
- `CRISPASR_QWEN3_TTS_GREEDY` — force the talker's codebook-0 sampler to argmax
  (top_k=1). The frame sequence then depends only on the logits, so two
  backends agree if and only if their logits agree — this is the lever for
  telling a GPU miscompute apart from a sampling difference, and without it a
  CPU-vs-GPU token comparison proves nothing (#337).

### SenseVoice

### Sidon

- `CRISPASR_SIDON_FASTCONV` — DAC convolution mode (`off`, `k1-f16`, `k1-f32`, or `full`). Unset defaults to
  `k1-f16` on CUDA and `off` on Vulkan/CPU.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_RPE` — relative-position-bias formulation: `bucket-direct` (default), `bucket`, or `expand`
  (legacy `[head_dim, T, T]` expansion, ~1 GiB more predictor workspace at `T≈2825`; keeps the Vulkan
  `mul_mat` batching branch). All three are algebraically equivalent.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_DECODER_CHUNK_FRAMES` — maximum DAC core size in feature frames (default `512`). `0` decodes
  the whole utterance in one graph (~4.5 GiB at `T≈2825` vs ~0.79 GiB chunked). Chunked output is bit-exact
  against the whole-utterance decode.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_LOOKAHEAD` — set to `0` to disable the input padding (one leading predictor frame plus 1.5 s
  of right-side lookahead). Padding is on by default; without it the last ~12 ms of every clip is a full-scale
  transient.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_MAX_FRAMES` — predictor input cap in feature frames (default `3000`, ~58.5 s after the
  lookahead). Guards the `O(T^2)` attention.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_DEBUG` — print per-stage scheduler workspace sizes (per backend) after graph allocation.

- `CRISPASR_SILERO_LID_MAX_S`
- `CRISPASR_SILERO_LID_MIN_LOGIT` — evidence gate (#409): discard a silero LID answer whose top-1 RAW logit is below this floor (default `-2.0`; `-999` disables) and fall back to whisper-tiny LID. The raw-logit magnitude separates in-domain from out-of-domain audio where the softmax probability does not.

  historical behaviour until the decoded-output roundtrip has validated the path.

### TitaNet speaker

- `CRISPASR_TITANET_BENCH`
- `CRISPASR_TITANET_DUMP`
- `CRISPASR_TITANET_DUMP_MEL`
- `CRISPASR_TITANET_FORCE_SCALAR`
- `CRISPASR_TITANET_GGML`
- `CRISPASR_TITANET_GPU`
- `CRISPASR_TITANET_LEGACY`
- `CRISPASR_TITANET_REF_MEL`

Three compute paths exist and all are kept working; the default is the fastest
one measured per platform.

| path | selected by | measured, M1, 2 s segment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| legacy (Accelerate / hand-rolled) | default where `HAVE_ACCELERATE` | **71.7 ms** |
| ggml graph, CPU | default elsewhere; `CRISPASR_TITANET_GGML=1` | 277.3 ms |
| ggml graph, GPU | `CRISPASR_TITANET_GGML=1 CRISPASR_TITANET_GPU=1` | 31.9 ms *(but see below)* |

All three agree to cosine **1.000000** with each other and **0.999996** against
NVIDIA's `nemo_en_titanet_large.onnx` export fed the same mel — so the choice is
purely about speed.

⚠ **`CRISPASR_TITANET_GPU=1` is opt-in because it loses on real workloads
despite winning the micro-benchmark.** Diarization embeds one segment per call
at *variable* lengths, so every call reshapes the graph and the GPU allocator
re-reserves; and `CRISPASR_SPEAKER_EMBED_WORKERS` runs several embedders at once,
which contend for the one GPU. End-to-end on a 600 s clip, 47 segments:

```
workers=4, legacy   9994 ms    <- default, fastest
workers=1, legacy  12673 ms
workers=1, GPU     15275 ms
workers=4, GPU     49866 ms
```

Keep it for evaluating a discrete GPU (where the balance may differ) or for
`CRISPASR_SPEAKER_EMBED_WORKERS=1` on a machine with weak CPU cores. Bucketing
segment lengths so the graph shape stops changing is the work that would make
this path win generally.

`CRISPASR_TITANET_DUMP_MEL=<path>` writes the computed mel as `[T][n_mels]`
float32 — the counterpart to `CRISPASR_TITANET_REF_MEL`. Feeding that dump to an
upstream ONNX export separates the front-end from the network, which a single
end-to-end cosine cannot do.

### Whisper (Tiron speaker attribution)

- `CRISPASR_WHISPER_TIRON` — `0` forces the stock whisper decode for A/B. The
  Tiron constrained-decoding grammar is auto-on whenever the model's vocab has
  speaker tokens; plain greedy loses ~5 cpWER.
