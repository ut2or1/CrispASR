# Environment variables

CrispASR exposes a large number of environment variables — tuning knobs, device
placement overrides, benchmark timers, and debug/dump switches. This page is the
single reference for all of them: the naming convention, the cross-cutting
variables, the per-backend variables, and the ones CrispASR deliberately does
**not** own.

> This document was introduced for issue #265 ("consistency and documentation").
> The same change standardized every backend-owned variable onto one prefix and
> unified the reference-voice cache location (see below).

## Naming convention

Every CrispASR-owned variable is named:

```
CRISPASR_<BACKEND>_<FEATURE>
```

for example `CRISPASR_OMNIVOICE_CODEC_GPU`, `CRISPASR_IRODORI_CODEC_GPU`,
`CRISPASR_PARAKEET_BENCH`. Process-global variables that are not tied to one
backend drop the `<BACKEND>` segment (`CRISPASR_MODELS_DIR`, `CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU`).

### Legacy aliases and deprecation warnings

Historically many backends used a bare prefix (`OMNIVOICE_CODEC_GPU`,
`QWEN3_TTS_BENCH`, `CHATTERBOX_DEBUG`, …). Those bare names **still work** as
legacy aliases so existing scripts, notebooks, and Kaggle A/B kernels keep
running. The alias is derived automatically by stripping the `CRISPASR_` prefix,
so for any `CRISPASR_FOO_BAR` documented here the bare `FOO_BAR` is also honored.

The first time a run reads a value from a **legacy** name, CrispASR prints a
one-time notice to stderr:

```
[crispasr] warning: environment variable 'OMNIVOICE_CODEC_GPU' is deprecated and
will be removed in a future release; use 'CRISPASR_OMNIVOICE_CODEC_GPU' instead
(the old name still works for now). ...
```

Migrate to the canonical `CRISPASR_`-prefixed name at your convenience. To
silence the warnings (e.g. for a pipeline that scrapes stderr and cannot migrate
yet), set:

```
CRISPASR_SUPPRESS_ENV_DEPRECATION=1
```

The lookup + aliasing is implemented once in `src/core/crispasr_env.h`
(`crispasr_env::get / truthy / present`); new backends should read env vars
through that helper with a canonical `CRISPASR_`-prefixed name.

### Value/truthiness conventions

Most variables are read with one of two conventions — check the surrounding
suffix legend, but as a rule:

- **Flag (opt-in)** — set to `1` (or any non-empty, non-`0` value) to enable.
  Some legacy flags treat *being set at all* as on, so prefer `=1` / unset it
  entirely rather than `=0` when a flag's exact semantics matter.
- **Path / value** — the variable's value is a filesystem path, integer, or
  float used directly.

### Common suffix legend

The same feature suffixes recur across nearly every backend. Rather than repeat
them per backend below, they mean:

| Suffix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `_BENCH` | Print per-stage wall-clock timings for that engine. |
| `_DEBUG` / `_DIAG` | Verbose debug logging. |
| `_DUMP_DIR` / `_DUMP` / `_DUMP_*` | Write intermediate tensors / stages to disk (diagnostics, diff-harness). |
| `_FORCE_SCALAR` | Disable SIMD kernels (numeric-parity debugging). |
| `_GPU` / `_USE_GPU` / `_FORCE_METAL` | Force that stage/codec onto the GPU. |
| `_CPU` / `_CPU_ONLY` / `_FORCE_CPU` | Force that stage/codec onto the CPU. |
| `_NO_FA` / `_FLASH_ATTN` | Toggle flash-attention. |
| `_FASTCONV` (`_DEBUG`) | Enable the baked-F32 / matmul conv fast path for a codec/vocoder. |
| `_CFG_INTERVAL` (`_DEBUG`) | Interval-CFG cadence for a flow-matching decoder. |
| `_SEED` | RNG seed for reproducible generation. |
| `_*_FILE` / `_*_PATH` / `_*_GGUF` | Override an asset/model/fixture path (mostly dev/test). |

## Global / cross-cutting variables

These are not tied to a single backend.

### Paths, cache, and models

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_MODELS_DIR` | Directory searched for GGUF models (also the auto-download target root). |
| `CRISPASR_CACHE_DIR` | Base cache directory for auto-downloaded models/assets (default `~/.cache/crispasr`). |
| `CRISPASR_SCRATCH_DIR` | Scratch directory for temporary run artifacts. |
| `CRISPASR_DUMP_DIR` | Global tensor-dump directory (diagnostics). |
| `CRISPASR_GGUF_MMAP` / `CRISPASR_GGUF_PRELOAD` | Control GGUF mmap vs. preload-into-RAM loading. |
| `CRISPASR_MLOCK` | mlock model weights into RAM. |
| `CRISPASR_IGNORE_CPU_ISA` | Continue past the startup build-vs-host CPU instruction-set check (#380) instead of exiting; the process will SIGILL at the first compute op the CPU can't run. |

### GPU / device placement

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_N_GPU_LAYERS` | Number of transformer layers to offload to the GPU. |
| `CRISPASR_ARG_DEVICE` | Default device selection for the CLI. |
| `CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU` | Keep the KV cache on the CPU. |
| `CRISPASR_KV_QUANT` / `_KV_QUANT_K` / `_KV_QUANT_V` / `_KV_READ_F32` | KV-cache quantization / read format. |

> Device *selection* across compiled backends also honors the standard ggml /
> CUDA variables `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and `GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES` — see
> "Variables CrispASR does not own" below.

### Session / long-audio chunking

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_SESSION_AUTOCHUNK` | Enable auto-chunking in the session API for long audio. |
| `CRISPASR_SESSION_CHUNK_SECONDS` | Chunk length (seconds) for session auto-chunking. |
| `CRISPASR_SESSION_PERBACKEND_CHUNK` | Use per-backend chunk-window tuning instead of a flat window. |
| `CRISPASR_SESSION_UNIFIED_DISPATCH` | Route surfaces through the unified library dispatch path. |

### Post-decode hygiene (PLAN.md §W2–W7)

All OFF unless set. Each of these can delete or alter user-visible text, so
none of them switches on by surprise; a wrong deletion is worse than a
surviving artifact. Applied on both the CLI and the session C-ABI.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MAX_CHARS` | Truncate any segment longer than N **code points**, backing up to the last `。．.！!？?、,` but never below 75% of the cap. A line past the cap is almost always a repetition hallucination that survived the n-gram collapse. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_DROP_NONVERBAL` | Drop segments that are entirely a non-verbal marker — `[Music]`, `(applause)`, `（喘ぎ声）`, `♪`. Running speech merely *containing* such a word is never dropped. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_LOGPROB_THOLD` | Drop segments whose average log-probability is below this. Post-hoc, on top of the decoder's own fallback gate. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_LOGPROB_MARGIN` | Loosen that threshold by this much for segments ≤1.6 s — a short segment's mean logprob is noisier, so it gets more room, not less. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MERGE_REPEATS` | Collapse runs of near-identical adjacent segments into one spanning the whole run. Catches a phrase repeating *across* segment boundaries, which per-segment loop fixes cannot see. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MERGE_SIMILARITY` | Similarity bar for the above (default 0.90; LCS over code points). |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MERGE_GAP_CS` | Never merge across a gap wider than this many centiseconds (default 200). Two identical lines a minute apart are two real utterances. |
| `CRISPASR_SEG_MERGE_MIN_RUN` | Minimum consecutive similar segments before merging (default 3), so an ordinary repeated "yes." pair survives. |

### Alignment and VAD sanity checks

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_ALIGN_SENTINEL` | `0` disables the forced-alignment collapse check. On by default, **detect + warn only**. Catches `ctc_forced_align()` returning words at `t0 == t1 == 0` — its two silent-zero paths (characters absent from the CTC vocab, or a word the Viterbi path never visited) produce garbage timestamps inside a *successful* return. |
| `CRISPASR_ALIGN_SENTINEL_REDISTRIBUTE` | `1` opts into repair: respace the words across the clip in proportion to character count. Off by default — a wrong auto-repair would be just as invisible as the collapse. |
| `CRISPASR_VAD_FAILOVER` | `0` disables the VAD sanity check. On by default: if a clip over 120 s comes back with under 1% speech coverage (or a couple of segments covering under 10% of a very long clip), the VAD is wrong and the run falls back to fixed full-clip chunks rather than losing the transcript. |
| `CRISPASR_NGRAM_LOOPFIX_OFF` | `1` disables the repeated-n-gram collapse entirely, exposing the RAW decoded text. Diagnostic: for telling whether a loop originates in the decode itself or is merely being masked. |

### Decoding / beam search (shared)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_MAES_BETA` / `_MAES_GAMMA` / `_MAES_NUM_STEPS` | MAES beam-search parameters. |
| `CRISPASR_TDT_BATCH` / `CRISPASR_RNNT_BATCH` | Batch the TDT / RNNT joint decode. |
| `CRISPASR_RNNT_GGML_PERSTEP` | Per-step (vs. persistent-graph) ggml RNNT decode. |
| `CRISPASR_NGRAM_LOOPFIX_OFF` | Disable the n-gram decode-loop breaker. |
| `CRISPASR_GAP_FILL` / `_GAP_FILL_MIN_CS` | Re-transcribe spans a first pass left empty (long audio); on by default for parakeet, threshold non-JA 300 cs / JA 100 cs. |

### G2P / phonemizer

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_CMUDICT_PATH` | Path to the CMUdict pronunciation dictionary. |
| `CRISPASR_DE_DICT_PATH` / `_FR_DICT_PATH` / `_ES_DICT_PATH` | Language-specific pronunciation dictionaries. |
| `CRISPASR_G2P_DICT_SOURCE` / `_G2P_MODEL_PATH` | G2P dictionary source / neural G2P model path. |
| `CRISPASR_ESPEAK_DATA_PATH` | eSpeak-NG data directory. |
| `CRISPASR_KOKORO_G2P` | Kokoro G2P backend selection. |
| `CRISPASR_KOKORO_MISAKI_IPA` | `0` disables the espeak-IPA → misaki-alphabet conversion Kokoro needs (#316), restoring the raw G2P spelling for A/B. On by default. |
| `CRISPASR_G2P_DE_UNSTRESS` | `1` reads the German closed class the way espeak reads it in a SENTENCE (`sie` → `ziː`) instead of the citation form our per-word dictionary stores (`zˈiː`). Off by default: it takes phoneme agreement with espeak from 45.9% to 87.1%, but the ASR round-trip could not resolve a difference, and that metric measures intelligibility rather than naturalness (#316). |
| `CRISPASR_KOKORO_DE_MISAKI_ALPHABET` | `1` applies misaki's tied-sequence collapse for German (`tsvˈaɪ` → `ʦvˈI`), which is what the published training recipe does. Off by default: it made the ASR round-trip worse on the `kokoro-de-hui-base` model we ship, which appears to predate that part of the recipe (#316). The `ʏ`→`y` vocabulary fixup is applied either way. |
| `CRISPASR_T5_REPEAT_BREAK` | `0` disables the decode-loop break for madlad/T5 translation, restoring exact PyTorch-blueprint behaviour. On by default: MADLAD greedy-decodes into a repeated token cycle on some short inputs and burns the whole token budget on it. The blueprint does the same — this is a deliberate improvement on it, not a parity fix (#333). |
| `CRISPASR_T5_NO_KV_REUSE` | `1` re-forwards the whole decoder prefix each step instead of appending to the KV cache. Same output, much slower; an A/B lever for isolating cache bugs (#333). |
| `CRISPASR_T5_KEEP_EMBED` | `1` keeps `shared.embed.*` and `lm_head.*` at source precision when quantizing a T5 model. **Off by default because it was measured and loses**: on madlad400 it makes q8_0 3.38→3.62 GB and q4_k 2.04→2.41 GB for a worst-stage cosine that does not improve (0.999922→0.999920, 0.992929→0.992606). The Q4_K loss accumulates through the 32 encoder blocks, not in the embedding lookup (#333). |
| `CRISPASR_KOKORO_PUNCT` | `0` drops punctuation from the phoneme string for the German/French/Spanish built-in G2Ps, restoring pre-0.8.26 behaviour for A/B. On by default: Kokoro's vocabulary contains `,.;:!?` and they are how it pauses (#316). English is not gated — it is settled against misaki. |

### Watermark / provenance

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_NO_WATERMARK` | Disable the audio watermark. |
| `CRISPASR_WATERMARK_LEGACY` | Use the legacy watermark path. |
| `CRISPASR_NO_C2PA_REMUX` | Skip the C2PA MP4 remux step. |

### Quantization / diff-harness / misc

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_QUANT_LMHEAD` | Quantize the LM head during `crispasr-quantize`. |
| `CRISPASR_IMATRIX_OUT` | Importance-matrix output path. |
| `CRISPASR_ACTDUMP_OUT` / `_ACTDUMP_TENSOR` | Activation dump output / target tensor. |
| `CRISPASR_DIFF_NO_GPU` / `_DIFF_USE_GPU` / `_DIFF_SLICES` / `_DIFF_STAGES` | `crispasr-diff` harness controls. |
| `CRISPASR_MEL_PARALLEL` / `_MEL_TIMING` | Parallelize / time mel-spectrogram computation. |
| `CRISPASR_VERBOSE` | Global verbose output. |
| `CRISPASR_NO_WARMUP` / `CRISPASR_WARMUP` | Skip / force the model warmup pass. |
| `CRISPASR_SERVER_WORKERS` / `CRISPASR_API_KEYS` | HTTP server worker count / API keys. |

## Reference-voice cache (voice cloning)

Encoding a reference clip for voice cloning (a codec encoder, a Conformer /
Perceiver, or an ASR pass) is slow and produces a small, reusable blob. Every
voice-cloning TTS backend caches that blob through **one shared mechanism**
(`src/core/tts_ref_cache.h`), so the location and disable switch are identical
across backends (issue #265 unified OmniVoice — which previously used a bespoke
`~/.cache/crispasr` cache — onto this path):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_TTS_REF_CACHE` | Set to `0` to disable reference-voice caching everywhere. |
| `CRISPASR_TTS_REF_CACHE_DIR` | Override the cache directory (default `<TMPDIR>/crispasr-tts-refcache`). |

Content-addressed entries are keyed by a hash of the raw reference (plus, for
some backends, an encoder-weight fingerprint) and tagged per backend
(`irodori-latent`, `openvoice2-se`, `omnivoice-voice`, `f5-reftext`, …) so no two
backends read each other's blob. OmniVoice additionally honors the legacy
`CRISPASR_OMNIVOICE_VOICE_CACHE=0` as an alias for the shared disable switch.

## Variables CrispASR does not own

These are read by CrispASR but are **OS / third-party conventions** and are
intentionally *not* renamed to the `CRISPASR_` prefix:

| Variable | Origin |
|----------|--------|
| `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | OS home / cache dirs. |
| `TMPDIR`, `TEMP`, `TMP` | OS temp dir (also the default ref-cache root). |
| `HF_TOKEN`, `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` | HuggingFace auth (Hub convention). |
| `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | CUDA device selection. |
| `GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | ggml Vulkan device selection. |
| `LLAMA_*` | Vendored `llama.cpp` (talk-llama example). |

### Sibling modular libraries (own conventions)

The in-tree modular libraries keep their own established prefixes and are synced
from their sibling repos, so their variables are **not** part of the `CRISPASR_`
scheme:

- **`crisp_audio/`** — audio tower: `CRISP_AUDIO_DUMP_STAGES`, `CRISP_AUDIO_KEEP_PAD_FRAMES`, `CRISP_AUDIO_WINDOWED_ATTN`.
- **`glint/`** — clean-room MP3/AAC codec: `GLINT_*`, `AACDBG`.
- **`crisp_lid/` · `crisp_punc/` · `crisp_truecase/`** — standalone LID / punctuation / truecasing libraries; they and their `src/` counterparts follow each library's own naming (`LID_*`, `FIREREDPUNC_*`, `PCS_*`, `TRUECASER_*`). `FIREREDPUNC_DEBUG=1` prints each restore pass as `[PUNCDBG] in=<…>` / `out=<…>`, which is the quickest way to see a backend's *true* model output — `--no-punctuation` is not, because it strips punctuation after the fact and so hides text the model punctuated itself.
  > ⚠ **These libraries are built by the main target, and each has a second copy under `src/`.** `src/CMakeLists.txt` prefers `crisp_punc/` (etc.) and falls back to the `src/` copy only when the sibling directory is missing from a checkout — so the `crisp_punc/` copy is what normally links, and **a change must be applied to both**. #308's capitalisation fix went into `src/fireredpunc.cpp` alone and was dead code for months while the shipping copy kept the bug. `tests/test-punc-copies-in-sync.cpp` now fails if they diverge.

## Test fixtures

The live/integration test suite reads a few `CRISPASR_`-prefixed fixture
variables (model/audio paths); `tests/env-live-tests.sh` sets sensible defaults.
Like every other variable here, the pre-standardization bare names are still
honored as deprecated aliases:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CRISPASR_PARAFORMER_MODEL` / `_PARAFORMER_MODEL_Q4K` / `_PARAFORMER_AUDIO_ZH` / `_PARAFORMER_AUDIO_EN` | Paraformer test model / audio paths. |
| `CRISPASR_AUDIOSEAL_GGUF` | AudioSeal test model path. |
| `CRISPASR_PIPER_TEST_MODEL` | Piper phonemize test model path. |
| `CRISPASR_OV2_DUMP_DIR` | OpenVoice2 HiFi test dump directory. |
| `CRISPASR_MODEL_BTC_CHORDS` | BTC chord-recognition test model path. Defaults to `$CRISPASR_MODELS_DIR/btc-chords-large-f32.gguf`. |

---

# Per-backend variables

Every variable below is the canonical `CRISPASR_`-prefixed name; the bare form
(without `CRISPASR_`) is accepted as a deprecated alias. See the **suffix
legend** above for the meaning of the common `_BENCH` / `_DEBUG` / `_DUMP_*` /
`_GPU` / `_CPU` / `_FORCE_SCALAR` / `_FASTCONV` / `_CFG_INTERVAL` / `_SEED`
suffixes.

### BTC chord recognition

- `CRISPASR_BTC_MAJ_MIN` — collapse the 170-class chord output to the 25-class
  maj/min vocabulary. Default off (full 170-class output): 170 reduces to
  maj/min at runtime, but a 25-class model can never be expanded, so the
  170-class checkpoint is the shipping default.

> The shipped BTC weights are **CC-BY-NC-SA** (trained on Isophonics / Robbie
> Williams / UsPop2002 chord annotations) even though the upstream BTC code and
> CrispASR itself are MIT. The registry refuses to download them without
> `--accept-license cc-by-nc-sa-4.0` (or `CRISPASR_ACCEPT_LICENSE`). A

  once per reference. Output-identical; the cached path is ~30% faster on a
  multi-sentence `--tts` (#334).
- `CRISPASR_COSYVOICE3_NO_MIN_LEN` — drop the decode's minimum-length floor
  (2 speech tokens per target text token, upstream's `min_token_text_ratio`).
  Without the floor a single unlucky sample at step 0 ends the decode with no
  audio at all (#334).

### HTDemucs (source separation)

- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_BLAS` — route the CrossTransformer matmuls through
  `cblas_sgemm` (default **ON** where Accelerate is available). `=0` selects the
  scalar path. The transformer is ~86% of an unoptimised forward pass, so this is
  the dominant knob (measured 44x on the transformer, 4.6x overall).
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_FASTCONV` — batched im2col + one GEMM for the CPU convs
  (default **ON**). `=0` selects the original per-time-frame scalar path.
  Measured `enc.conv2d` 10.0 s -> 0.17 s and `enc.rewrite` 12.2 s -> 0.30 s.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_WCACHE` — cache F32 copies of weight tensors by pointer
  (default **ON**). `=0` re-reads and re-converts on every access, which the
  DConv stacks do ~6k times per encoder layer.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_GGML` — run the CrossTransformer as a ggml graph instead of
  the CPU/BLAS path (default **OFF**). Verified correct on CPU and Metal (45/45
  stages, every layer cos 1.000000) but not yet proven faster overall, so it
  stays opt-in per the inverse-default rule.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_GPU` — request a GPU backend (CUDA > Metal > Vulkan, CPU
  fallback). Only meaningful together with `_GGML=1`: under the CPU/BLAS path
  the weights would sit on the device and every kernel would pay a read back.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_PROFILE` — print a per-phase wall-time breakdown of one
  forward pass (stft / enc / transformer / dec / istft).
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_DEBUG` — verbose per-layer shape and NaN diagnostics.
- `CRISPASR_HTDEMUCS_SKIP_TIME` — skip the time branch (bisection aid).

All three optimisation gates are output-equivalent: the per-stage diff reports
45/45 stages passing with them ON or OFF.

### Diarization — foxnose (#324)

- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_COUNT` — speaker-count estimator: `bic` (default, the
  upstream GMM/BIC + silhouette sweep) or `eigengap`. Eigengap is better on
  well-separated synthetic data and cheaper, but under-counts on real speech
  (11.4 % vs 5.3 % DER on VoxConverse) — see `docs/foxnose-diarize/PLAN.md`
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_BIC_WINDOW` — score silhouette only in a `[k-2, k+3]` window
  around the BIC anchor instead of the full `[min, max]` range. The full range is
  the default: the BIC anchor is unreliable in both directions (measured errors
  of +5 / -3 / -3 on 4/5/6 well-separated blobs) and when it over-counts the
  window is stranded above the truth and cannot climb back to it
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_BENCH` — per-stage embedder timings (fbank / resnet /
  resnet_windows). Counting invocations of these is also how you check WHICH
  embedding path actually ran
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_DEBUG` — embedder diagnostics
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_DEBUG` — chosen speaker count, the reason it was chosen,
  and the per-k silhouette curve behind it. Worth reading before trusting a
  count: on a borderline file the decision can rest on a <1 % score gap
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_EMBED_WORKERS` — windows embedded concurrently (default:
  `-t`). Each worker gets its own context sharing one copy of the weights
- `CRISPASR_SPEAKER_EMBED_THREADS` — ggml threads per embedder context
  (default: `-t`). Honoured by the pluggable embedders and by wespeaker
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_SPAN_EMBED=1` — run ONE network pass per span of windows
  instead of one per window. 1.78x less diarization CPU for +0.30 mean DER on
  the VoxConverse dev shard; off by default because accuracy is the better
  default for a diarizer. See `docs/cli.md#diarization`
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_SPAN_WINDOWS` — windows per span (default 32). Measured NOT
  to affect the accuracy cost — identical from N=2 to N=32 — so there is
  nothing to tune here; larger is simply faster
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_CONV` — conv lowering for the WeSpeaker embedder:
  `im2col` (default) lowers each conv to explicit IM2COL + MUL_MAT nodes so
  the GEMMs reach the Accelerate BLAS backend on CPU and the simdgroup
  mul_mm kernels on Metal; `direct` restores GGML_OP_CONV_2D. Measured on
  esrit.wav (215 s, `-t 8`): diarization delta 9.8 s -> 5.9 s (~1.6x),
  embeddings cosine 1.0 vs direct, DER identical per file (7.32 % shard mean)
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_GPU=1` — run the WeSpeaker embedder on the GPU backend
  (single context; the CPU worker pool is stood down because workers borrow
  weights that now live in a GPU buffer). With the im2col default and batched
  windows Metal reaches parity with the 8-worker CPU schedule on an M-series
  (8.5 s vs 8.7 s wall on esrit.wav) but does not beat it, so CPU stays the
  default; the switch exists for machines where the GPU/CPU balance differs
- `CRISPASR_DIARIZE_BATCH_EMBED` — batch independent 1.2 s windows into one
  graph along ne[3] (arithmetic-identical to per-window; cosine 1.0). Default:
  ON under `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_GPU=1` (collapses ~350 Metal dispatches into
  ~11 and is what got Metal from a 2x loss to parity), OFF on CPU (measured
  12.1 -> 14.9 s wall on esrit.wav: ggml's CPU conv loops ne[3], so fusing
  buys no GEMM shape and the 32-window chunks starve the worker schedule).
  `1`/`0` forces either way
- `CRISPASR_WESPEAKER_BATCH` — max windows per batched graph (default 32 on
  GPU, 16 on CPU; cap 32). Only meaningful where the batch path is active

### GigaAM-v3

- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_BENCH` — per-stage timings (mel / encoder / decode)
- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_DEBUG` — encoder output min/max/mean
- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_FLASH` — `ggml_flash_attn_ext` in the encoder (opt-in; the
  manual QK^T path is what the per-stage diff was validated on)
- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_FORCE_SCALAR` — scalar LSTM/joint loops instead of cblas
- `CRISPASR_GIGAAM_QUANT_ALL` — let `crispasr-quantize` quantize the heads and
  the pre-encode convs too (default keeps them at source precision)

### OmniVoice

- `CRISPASR_OMNIVOICE_ACENC_BISECT`
- `CRISPASR_OMNIVOICE_AUTO_LANG` — **default on.** When no language was requested
  (`-l` / `-tl` / the server's `"language"` / `set_target_language`), guess one
  from the text being spoken and use it if it maps to an id the model knows.
  An explicitly requested language always wins; a low-confidence guess resolves
  to nothing and behaves exactly as before. `=0` restores the old
  always-language-agnostic behaviour. Exists because SubtitleEdit's language
  menu is not yet wired to its request payload (#13273).

  posteriors do not change with `-t`

- `CRISPASR_QWEN3_TTS_REPLAY_CODES=<file>` — 16 whitespace-separated codec ids
  per frame; the decode uses them instead of sampling. Teacher forcing, and
  the ONLY way to compare two backends step by step: pin the whole frame or
  the 15 residual codebooks (which must be sampled) diverge and the diff
  measures trajectory, not arithmetic (#337).
- `CRISPASR_QWEN3_TTS_REPLAY_TOKENS=<file>` — the weaker form: codebook-0 ids
  only. Useful for forcing a trajectory, NOT sufficient for a logits diff.
- `CRISPASR_QWEN3_TTS_GREEDY` — force the talker's codebook-0 sampler to argmax
  (top_k=1). The frame sequence then depends only on the logits, so two
  backends agree if and only if their logits agree — this is the lever for
  telling a GPU miscompute apart from a sampling difference, and without it a
  CPU-vs-GPU token comparison proves nothing (#337).

### Sidon

- `CRISPASR_SIDON_FASTCONV` — DAC convolution mode (`off`, `k1-f16`, `k1-f32`, or `full`). Unset defaults to
  `k1-f16` on CUDA and `off` on Vulkan/CPU.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_RPE` — relative-position-bias formulation: `bucket-direct` (default), `bucket`, or `expand`
  (legacy `[head_dim, T, T]` expansion, ~1 GiB more predictor workspace at `T≈2825`; keeps the Vulkan
  `mul_mat` batching branch). All three are algebraically equivalent.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_DECODER_CHUNK_FRAMES` — maximum DAC core size in feature frames (default `512`). `0` decodes
  the whole utterance in one graph (~4.5 GiB at `T≈2825` vs ~0.79 GiB chunked). Chunked output is bit-exact
  against the whole-utterance decode.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_LOOKAHEAD` — set to `0` to disable the input padding (one leading predictor frame plus 1.5 s
  of right-side lookahead). Padding is on by default; without it the last ~12 ms of every clip is a full-scale
  transient.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_MAX_FRAMES` — predictor input cap in feature frames (default `3000`, ~58.5 s after the
  lookahead). Guards the `O(T^2)` attention.
- `CRISPASR_SIDON_DEBUG` — print per-stage scheduler workspace sizes (per backend) after graph allocation.

- `CRISPASR_TITANET_REF_MEL`

Three compute paths exist and all are kept working; the default is the fastest
one measured per platform.

| path | selected by | measured, M1, 2 s segment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| legacy (Accelerate / hand-rolled) | default where `HAVE_ACCELERATE` | **71.7 ms** |
| ggml graph, CPU | default elsewhere; `CRISPASR_TITANET_GGML=1` | 277.3 ms |
| ggml graph, GPU | `CRISPASR_TITANET_GGML=1 CRISPASR_TITANET_GPU=1` | 31.9 ms *(but see below)* |

All three agree to cosine **1.000000** with each other and **0.999996** against
NVIDIA's `nemo_en_titanet_large.onnx` export fed the same mel — so the choice is
purely about speed.

⚠ **`CRISPASR_TITANET_GPU=1` is opt-in because it loses on real workloads
despite winning the micro-benchmark.** Diarization embeds one segment per call
at *variable* lengths, so every call reshapes the graph and the GPU allocator
re-reserves; and `CRISPASR_SPEAKER_EMBED_WORKERS` runs several embedders at once,
which contend for the one GPU. End-to-end on a 600 s clip, 47 segments:

```
workers=4, legacy   9994 ms    <- default, fastest
workers=1, legacy  12673 ms
workers=1, GPU     15275 ms
workers=4, GPU     49866 ms
```

Keep it for evaluating a discrete GPU (where the balance may differ) or for
`CRISPASR_SPEAKER_EMBED_WORKERS=1` on a machine with weak CPU cores. Bucketing
segment lengths so the graph shape stops changing is the work that would make
this path win generally.

`CRISPASR_TITANET_DUMP_MEL=<path>` writes the computed mel as `[T][n_mels]`
float32 — the counterpart to `CRISPASR_TITANET_REF_MEL`. Feeding that dump to an
upstream ONNX export separates the front-end from the network, which a single
end-to-end cosine cannot do.
