## Backend × Optimization matrix

At-a-glance view of which performance knobs each backend supports today,
and where the gaps are. Last refresh: **2026-05-04** (after PLAN §79 —
14-commit session that shipped #69a / #69b / #69e / #72 / #73).

**Legend**: ✓ = supported, opt-in via env var · `F16` = stuck at F16
(quant cache types unavailable; attention path needs migration) ·
`—` = not applicable (no KV cache or no transformer blocks) ·
`·` = applicable but not yet wired (port deferred).

### TTS

| backend | KV_QUANT | KV_QUANT_K/_V | KV_ON_CPU | N_GPU_LAYERS | notes |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| orpheus (3B + DE / lex-au variants) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | shared Llama-3 path |

| kokoro | — | — | — | — | non-AR vocoder, no transformer KV |

### Where the gaps are

1. **Layer offload (`N_GPU_LAYERS`) on encoder-decoder ASR** (canary,
   cohere, kyutai-stt). Their cross-attention layout doesn't have the
   `blk.<N>.*` block-tagged tensors that the layer-split predicate
   recognises. Encoder-decoder offload is its own design problem —
   probably want to offload only the LLM/decoder side, but the tensor
   names (`<arch>.dec.<N>.*` etc.) need bespoke per-backend predicates.
2. **vibevoice quant K/V (both modes)**. The attention path uses the
   `ggml_cpy(K_perm, view_into_kv_k)` pattern that's incompatible with
   quant K/V (see LEARNINGS.md "ggml_cont(ggml_permute(quant_tensor))
   doesn't move data"). Migration recipe is the canary/cohere
   `ggml_flash_attn_ext` port — ~50-80 LOC + F16 mask graph input.
   Layer offload (`N_GPU_LAYERS`) is independently shipped and works
   on F16 K/V; the migration only unlocks quant K/V on top.
3. **qwen3-tts code-predictor cache**. Talker KV is fully covered via
   `core_attn::kv_self_attn`; the secondary code-predictor path
   doesn't go through that helper, so its cache stays F16. Lower-
   priority since the talker dominates per-frame cost.
4. **Linux/CUDA validation of #72 GPU residency.** mimo-asr 22 % /
   gemma4-e2b 2.2x speedups were measured on Apple Silicon Metal.
   dGPU should be even more favourable; deferred until a CUDA host
   is available. If a platform regresses, gate via env
   (`CRISPASR_FORCE_CPU_WEIGHTS=1`).
5. **Cohere flash_attn_ext regresses on short audio.** JFK (~11 s)
   with q8_0 K / q4_0 V is +11 % slower under flash than under the
   cast-on-read fallback (canary on the same workload is -17 %, so
   the kernel works — cohere's cache layout or head dim flips the
   crossover). Need a multi-minute clip to confirm flash pulls ahead
   on long-form before promoting it to the recommended path; until
   then short-form users on cohere should treat flash as opt-in.

### Stacking the four knobs

Each addresses an independent bottleneck:

| knob | addresses | when to use |
|---|---|---|
| `CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_K=q8_0 / _V=q4_0` | KV size in VRAM | always reasonable for LLM-decode ASR; quartered V cache on long context |
| `CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU=1` | KV doesn't fit in VRAM at all | very long context with a tight VRAM budget |
| `CRISPASR_N_GPU_LAYERS=N` | model itself doesn't fit in VRAM | model size > VRAM; spill the last (total-N) layers |
| `CRISPASR_FORCE_CPU_WEIGHTS=1` (proposed) | platform regressed on §72 GPU residency | not yet wired — none seen on Apple Silicon |

```bash
# Maximum-memory-savings combo for a VRAM-tight host
CRISPASR_N_GPU_LAYERS=10 \
  CRISPASR_KV_ON_CPU=1 \
  CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_K=q8_0 \
  CRISPASR_KV_QUANT_V=q4_0 \
  ./build/bin/crispasr --backend voxtral4b -m auto -f long.wav
```

## CPU-only VPS — 2026-04-24

Platform: x86_64, 4 threads, 7.6 GB RAM, AVX2, no GPU.

| Backend | RTx (CPU) | Time (CPU) | RTx (T4) | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FastConformer CTC | 9.4x | 1.2s | 9.6x | 1.1x |
| Moonshine Tiny | 16.8x | 0.7s | 6.7x | 0.4x* |

| FireRed ASR2 AED | 0.1x | 123s | 0.6x | 6.5x |

*Moonshine runs CPU-only on both (tiny model, no GPU benefit).

GPU acceleration is strongest for encoder-heavy models (2-6x). Decoder-bound
models benefit less (FireRed decoder still runs on CPU even with GPU).

## Per-phase breakdowns

### wav2vec2 family (Kaggle T4)

| Model | CNN | Pos conv | Encoder | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| wav2vec2-large (24L) | 215ms | 1588ms | 127ms | 1941ms |
| hubert-large (24L) | 227ms | 1595ms | 128ms | 1960ms |
| data2vec-base (12L) | 221ms | 735ms | 57ms | 1023ms |

**Bottleneck:** pos_conv (grouped conv1d on CPU) = 50-80% of total time.
Encoder graph on GPU is only 57-128ms.

### FireRed AED decoder (Kaggle T4)

| Phase | Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fbank extraction | ~50ms | CPU |
| Conv2d subsampling | ~100ms | CPU |
| Hybrid encoder (16L) | ~17s | GPU matmuls + CPU attention, slow due to CPU weight copies |
| K/V precompute | 433ms | GPU (scheduler auto-copies) |
| Decoder (28 steps) | 1695ms | CPU Q4_K SIMD, 60.5ms/step |
| **Total** | **19.0s** | Encoder dominates |

### OmniASR (Kaggle T4)

| Model | Encoder | Prefill | Decode | Total | RTx |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CTC 1B v2 | 244ms | — | — | 277ms | 39.8x (encoder only) |
| LLM 300M v2 | 97ms | 803ms | 4028ms (103 steps) | 5021ms | 2.2x |

---

## Key observations

1. **CTC models dominate on speed.** No decoder loop = one forward pass.
2. **Small LLM decoders (0.6-1B) are competitive** — Qwen3 and GLM hit 4.5x+
   realtime with 0% WER, close to encoder-only models.
3. **Large LLMs (3-4.5B) are 1-2x realtime** on T4. Usable but not fast.
4. **Most WER=0% on jfk.wav.** The 4.5% models have minor formatting differences,
   not actual transcription errors. Moonshine Tiny (9.1%) has a real word error.
5. **wav2vec2 pos_conv was the bottleneck** — now 4.9x faster with ggml grouped
   conv (im2col + mul_mat SIMD). Was 1.6s (80% of runtime), now 324ms (~3.5%).
6. **FireRed encoder is slow** because CPU weights auto-copy to GPU per-layer.
   Pre-loading encoder weights to GPU would save ~15s.

## Optimization history

### wav2vec2 grouped conv — 2026-04-27

| Path | pos_conv | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Manual C++ (OMP) | 1588ms | 4-thread OMP, plain float loops |
| **ggml im2col + mul_mat** | **324ms** | **4.9x faster**, SIMD kernels |

The grouped positional conv (C=1024, K=128, G=16) is decomposed into G=16
independent `ggml_pad_ext` + `ggml_im2col` + `ggml_mul_mat` calls. The
mul_mat output `[cpg, T]` is transposed to channel-first before reassembly.
Applies to wav2vec2, data2vec, and hubert.

### FireRed decoder — 2026-04-26

| Path | ms/step | 28 tokens | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manual C++ F32 (original) | 4400 | 123s | No SIMD, no parallelism |
| + OpenMP matmuls | 2320 | 58s | 2.1x from OMP |
| + ggml Q4_K CPU native | **70** | **2.0s** | 9.3x from fused SIMD kernel |
| ggml_vecmat on CUDA | 2600 | timeout | CUDA launch overhead kills it |
| F32 dequant + cpu_matmul | 590 | 16.5s | No SIMD, OMP disabled on Kaggle |
| **ggml_vecmat CPU (final)** | **60** | **1.7s** | Weights on CPU, native Q4_K |

### wav2vec2 CNN — 2026-04-24

| Change | CNN | Total | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (manual C++) | 95.2s | 108.4s | 1.0x |
| ggml F32 im2col | 2.4s | 15.5s | 7.0x |
| + OpenMP pos_conv | 2.3s | 9.9s | 10.9x |

### voxtral4b streaming — 2026-05 (PLAN #7 phases 1+1.5+2+3+4)

Native incremental encoder + streaming-prompt decode + speculative
prefill + combined-chunk flush + live captions + decoder thread.
M1 Q4_K JFK 11 s baseline, all variants bit-exact-batch:

| Stage / phase | Metric | Before | After | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 (initial) | first-text-token | n/a | 2674ms | — |
| + 240ms chunks (phase 2) | feed total | 23s | 9.1s | 2.5× faster |
| + default-unification fix | encoder drain | 2064ms | 1016ms | -1.0s |
| + fused QKV (Q4_K) | per-decode-step | 56ms | 50.4ms | -10% |
| + combined-chunk flush (phase 3) | encoder drain | 990ms | 307ms | -683ms |
| + speculative prefill (phase 3) | first-text-token | 921ms | **650ms** | -271ms |

**Final**: first-text-token 2674ms → **650ms (4.1× faster)**;
sequential live decode (phase 3); decoder thread for non-blocking
feed (phase 4, gated on `CRISPASR_VOXTRAL4B_STREAM_DECODER_THREAD=1`).

The remaining ~410ms gap to the model's ≤240ms target is the
architectural floor: 8 streaming-pad warmup steps × 50.4ms + LLM
prefill = 655ms minimum on M1 Q4_K. Cross that floor only via a
faster Q4_K Metal kernel or a model with a different prompt
convention (no streaming-pad warmup).

Cross-backend portability of the fused-QKV Q4_K pattern:
- qwen3-asr Q4_K: default-on (transcript correct; perf within
  noise on JFK's short-decode shape)
- voxtral 3B Q4_K: opt-in (`CRISPASR_VOXTRAL_FUSED_QKV=1`); A/B
  showed no measurable speedup on JFK
- qwen3-tts: opt-in (existing convention)

### FastConformer encoder flash_attn_ext — 2026-05-09

Commit `c2423313` rewrites the FastConformer encoder self-attention
(parakeet, canary, canary_ctc) from 3 separate matmuls + add + softmax
for Shaw relative-position attention into a single `ggml_flash_attn_ext`
call per layer with the BD position bias precomputed and passed as the
additive mask. Reduces per-encoder-pass kernel dispatches from
32 layers × 3 matmuls = 96 down to 32 — the dominant win on GPUs
where per-launch overhead is real.

Re-verification on Apple M1 Metal (`build-ninja-compile/`,
`GGML_METAL=ON`, `GGML_BLAS=ON` Apple), 3-pass warm-cache JFK 11 s:

| Backend | Baseline (`c2423313~1`) median | Flash-attn (`c2423313`) median | Speedup | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| parakeet (TDT 0.6B v3 F16) | 2.57 s (4.3× RT) | 1.60 s (6.9× RT) | **1.61× (38% faster)** | bit-identical ✓ |
| canary (1B v2 Q4_K) | 1.53 s (7.2× RT) | 1.15 s (9.6× RT) | **1.33× (25% faster)** | bit-identical ✓ |

Substantially exceeds the commit message's CPU number (~10%), confirming
the GPU-vs-CPU hypothesis: with kernel-launch overhead in the picture,
fusion pays off ~3-4× more. Wallclock includes whisper-tiny LID
(~77 MB Metal load) and feature extraction — both unchanged across the
two builds, so the encoder-attention-only speedup is larger than the
table suggests. Parakeet benefits more than canary because its encoder
runs longer per token (TDT joint loop), so the 32-layer attention block
dominates a larger share of wallclock.

Issue #81 ("parakeet 5× slower than ONNX on GPU") — this commit closes
a chunk of the gap but not all of it. Next likely targets: decoder
loop, joint network, log-mel host→device transfer.

### onnx-asr cross-comparison — issue #81 (2026-05-09)

Replicating the issue reporter's setup (libcrispasr via Python ctypes,
parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3 q8_0 GGUF) and comparing against onnx-asr 0.11.0
on the same Apple M1, JFK 11 s, 3 warm passes per path. crispasr is at
flash-attn commit `c2423313`. ONNX backend selection follows
`istupakov/onnx-asr`'s upstream recipe (`pip install onnx-asr`).

**ONNX execution-provider reality check on M1:**

| ONNX model | CPU EP | CoreML EP |
|---|---|---|
| `nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` (F32, external-data, encoder 2.4 GB) | ✓ | ✗ external-data initializer + CoreML's 316-partition subgraph split lose `model_path`; inlining hits protobuf's 2 GB ceiling. Tracked upstream: [`microsoft/onnxruntime#26355`](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/26355), closed *not planned* |
| `nemo-parakeet-ctc-0.6b` (F32 + external data) | ✓ | ✗ same issue |
| `nemo-parakeet-ctc-0.6b` int8 (single-file, 650 MB) | ✓ | ✓ loads after ~10 s CoreML compile |

The upstream onnx-asr README claim "Works on … macOS … with support for
… CoreML" is therefore **partially true** on Apple Silicon for parakeet:
only the smaller CTC int8 single-file export reaches CoreML; the full
TDT (and full-precision CTC) exports stay CPU-only because of how
istupakov packages them with external-data tensors larger than
protobuf's 2 GB limit.

**TDT-vs-TDT bench** (JFK 11 s, 3 warm passes, load avg ~4.0):

| path | median | RT× |
|---|---|---|
| **crispasr ctypes Session, parakeet-tdt q8_0, Metal** | **1.34 s** | **8.24×** |
| onnx-asr `nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` F32, CPU EP | 1.77 s | 6.23× |

Apples-to-apples on the TDT architecture: **crispasr Metal beats
onnx-asr CPU by 1.32×.** The Q8_0 ctypes path is faster than the F16
CLI numbers above because it skips the CLI's whisper-tiny LID startup
(~77 MB Metal load) and output formatting overhead — closer to what
the issue reporter actually measured.

**CTC-vs-CTC bench** (JFK 11 s, 3 warm passes, all CTC outputs
identical, q8_0 quants, load avg ~2.6):

| path | median | RT× |
|---|---|---|
| **crispasr Session, parakeet-ctc-0.6b q8_0, Metal** | **~460 ms** | **~24×** |
| onnx-asr `nemo-parakeet-ctc-0.6b` (~600M) int8, CPU EP | 724 ms | 15.2× |
| onnx-asr `nemo-parakeet-ctc-0.6b` (~600M) int8, CoreML EP | 1279 ms | 8.6× |

(crispasr Metal value is from the `stt_en_fastconformer_ctc_xlarge` 3-pass
bench at load ~2.6 — identical encoder + CTC-head graph as
`parakeet-ctc-0.6b`, only the tokenizer + training data differ. The new
parakeet-ctc-0.6b GGUFs fall in the same window when measured under
the same load — variance ~0.4–0.7 s observed across loads 2.6–4.0.)

`nvidia/parakeet-ctc-0.6b` (24L) and `nvidia/parakeet-ctc-1.1b` (42L)
are now first-class in crispasr — the existing
`models/convert-stt-fastconformer-ctc-to-gguf.py` handles both (encoder
+ CTC head are architecturally identical to the `stt_en_fastconformer_ctc_*`
family); `examples/cli/crispasr_backend.cpp` auto-routes
`parakeet-ctc-*.gguf` filenames to the `fastconformer-ctc` backend (the
JA hybrid `parakeet-tdt_ctc-0.6b-ja` stays on the `parakeet` TDT path

**crispasr wins by ~1.6×** on the same upstream model on M1 Metal.

Two M1-specific surprises worth surfacing:

1. **CoreML EP is *slower* than CPU EP on M1** for parakeet-shaped
   graphs (CTC: 1.28 s vs 0.72 s on the same int8 model). M1's CPU
   vector pipeline + onnxruntime CPU kernels outpace CoreML's
   per-graph compile + dispatch overhead. ONNX users on Apple Silicon
   should default to CPU EP for parakeet, not CoreML.
2. **CoreML EP isn't even reachable for the upstream parakeet TDT
   ONNX export** (external-data + protobuf 2 GB ceiling, see table
   above). The headline "works on macOS with CoreML" claim only
   applies to the smaller CTC int8 single-file export.

**Reframing the 5× claim in issue #81:** the reporter is on Windows +
RTX 4070 + onnxruntime-directml — i.e. ONNX with a *working dGPU
execution provider*. DirectML on a 4070 is a real architectural
advantage no amount of ggml-side fusion will fully erase until our
CUDA / Vulkan kernels for the parakeet hot paths reach parity. On M1
the picture inverts: ONNX's only ergonomic path is CPU EP (or CoreML
EP for the smaller CTC int8 export, where it's *slower* than CPU
anyway), and crispasr Metal beats every ONNX path that loads — by
1.32× on TDT-vs-TDT and **1.58× on CTC-vs-CTC at the same param
count.** The actionable framing for the issue is "which CUDA / Vulkan
kernels in the parakeet path are leaving perf on the table on dGPU"
rather than "parakeet is slow on GPU universally."

### jason-ni/parakeet.cpp cross-comparison — issue #81 (2026-05-10)

[`jason-ni/parakeet.cpp`](https://github.com/jason-ni/parakeet.cpp) is
the prior public attempt at a ggml port of parakeet, referenced in
issue #81 as evidence that "ggml-based parakeet is slow." Author paused
2025-07 with the README note "the ggml implementation is not as
efficient as expected" after observing 1 s encoder time vs a claimed
0.001 s for parakeet-mlx. The 0.001 s claim is almost certainly an
async-dispatch return time on MLX, not actual compute — real MLX
encoder cost is in the same single-second range as ours and theirs.

**Scope of their build.** Encoder-only proof of concept for **Parakeet
TDT 0.6B v2** (English-only, MLX checkpoint), F32 weights, ~4 000 LOC
including a custom mini-runtime (`framework_*`). No decoder, no joint
network, no streaming, no quantisation, no Python/CLI integration.
Test harness is `parakeet_cpp <gguf> <pe.bin> <input.data>` — feeds
pre-baked mel features, returns encoder hidden states.

**Their graph.** Standard FastConformer encoder, 24 layers ×
(LN → FF1 → LN → self-attn → LN → conv → LN → FF2 → LN), exactly the
architecture we ship. The interesting differences are all in the self-
attention block at `src/framework_nn.cpp` lines 820–1010:

- **Shaw relative-position attention done as separate ops**:
  `matrix_ac = mul_mat(K, Q+u_bias)`,
  `matrix_bd = mul_mat(P_emb, Q+v_bias)`, then a left-pad + slice
  trick to align positions, add, scale, softmax, multiply by V.
  3 matmuls + softmax + matmul + several view/transpose passes per
  layer. Same shape as our pre-`c2423313` baseline.
- **`ggml_flash_attn_ext` path is written but commented out** (lines
  944–987). They had the fused approach drafted, didn't activate it —
  exactly the path our `c2423313` activates and tunes.
- **Conv2D pre-encode (subsampling)** uses `ggml_conv_2d` — same as
  us. Their conformer self-attn comment notes
  `weight f16 is required for ggml_conv_2d_dw` on Metal — same Metal
  constraint we observed.
- **F32 weights only**, no Q4_K / Q8_0 / F16 quantisation paths.

So architecturally their encoder is a sibling of ours minus the
2026-05 flash-attn-ext fusion. The "ggml is slow" finding they paused
on is exactly the bottleneck commit `c2423313` addresses (1.61× on
parakeet TDT v3 F16, M1 Metal).

**Apples-to-apples on their own test audio** (`assets/input.wav`,
47.74 s, mel features identical), encoder-only, 3 warm runs:

| build | hardware | precision | encoder mean | RT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| jason-ni/parakeet.cpp (their README) | Apple **M4** | F32 | 0.92 s | 51.9× |
| **crispasr `parakeet_test_encoder` (this commit, flash-attn-ext)** | Apple **M1** | F16 | **1.66 s** | **28.8×** |
| crispasr `parakeet_test_encoder` (this commit, flash-attn-ext) | Apple M1 | Q8_0 | 2.64 s | 18.1× |

Hardware-normalised: M4 GPU is ≈ 1.5–1.8× M1 on Metal compute,
putting jason-ni's number at ~30–35× RT on M1-equivalent hardware.
We're at 28.8× RT on M1 with F16 + flash-attn-ext — **roughly within
hardware noise of each other** for encoder-only. The gap they panicked
about against MLX is illusory; the gap against ours doesn't exist
once you normalise hardware.

**Important encoder-vs-pipeline note.** On the *encoder alone*, F16 is
faster than Q8_0 on Metal (Q8_0 dequant overhead doesn't pay off when
encoder ops are matmul-bandwidth-friendly even at F16). Q8_0 wins for
the **full pipeline** because the TDT joint network + label-predictor
LSTM run many small matmuls per output token where weight memory
bandwidth dominates. The `tools/benchmark_asr_engines` matrix puts
Q8_0 at 7.4× RT for full inference / 60 s. **Different shapes win
different quants** — pick by what your pipeline actually does, not
by quant name alone.

**What we have that they don't, attributable to specific work:**

1. Flash-attn-ext attention fusion (`c2423313`). Their `ggml_flash_attn_ext`
   path exists in code but is commented out.
2. Full TDT decoder (label predictor + joint network + per-frame TDT
   step). They're encoder-only.
3. Quantisation paths (Q4_K, Q5_0, Q8_0). They ship F32 only.
4. Multilingual TDT v3 support. They support v2 (English-only).
5. Production integration: CLI, `python/crispasr/Session`, streaming,
   VAD, mic, WER tooling, multi-backend dispatch. Theirs is a single
   test binary.
6. Cross-platform: CUDA / Vulkan / Metal / CPU. Theirs is
   Metal-focused (`-DGGML_METAL=ON`).

**Reframe of issue #81 in light of this**: the prior public ggml
attempt (jason-ni) plateaued at our pre-`c2423313` baseline and paused
on a misread benchmark. Our crispasr build, post-flash-attn fusion,
matches it on encoder-only and ships everything else around it. The
remaining issue #81 gap on Windows + RTX 4070 + DirectML is still
about CUDA/Vulkan kernel coverage on the dGPU side, not about ggml
fundamentally being too slow for parakeet.

Reproduce the encoder-only number:

```python
# Save jason-ni's input.wav reference: 47.74 s, 16 kHz mono.
# T_mel = 4774 (10 ms hop matches both their preprocess and ours).
import ctypes, time
lib = ctypes.CDLL('build-ninja-compile/src/libcrispasr.dylib')
lib.crispasr_parakeet_init.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_int]
lib.crispasr_parakeet_init.restype  = ctypes.c_void_p
lib.parakeet_test_encoder.argtypes  = [ctypes.c_void_p, ctypes.c_int]
lib.parakeet_test_encoder.restype   = ctypes.c_int
lib.crispasr_parakeet_free.argtypes = [ctypes.c_void_p]

ctx = lib.crispasr_parakeet_init(b'parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3.gguf', 4, 1)  # F16, flash-attn on
lib.parakeet_test_encoder(ctx, 4774)  # warm
for _ in range(3):
    t = time.perf_counter()
    lib.parakeet_test_encoder(ctx, 4774)
    print(f'{(time.perf_counter()-t)*1000:.0f} ms')
lib.crispasr_parakeet_free(ctx)
```

`parakeet_test_encoder` runs the full encoder graph with mel = zeros —
compute-bound, identical kernel dispatches to a real call, no I/O.
Use it instead of the CLI when you want encoder-only timing without
LID-model load, mel extraction, and the TDT decoder loop in the
wallclock.

### A1000 Ampere CUDA A/B (sm_86) — issue #81 (2026-05-10)

Adds the missing Ampere datapoint to the issue #81 cross-comparison.
Hardware: NVIDIA RTX A1000 Laptop GPU (sm_86, 4 GB VRAM, 35–40 W TDP)
on Windows 11 + WDDM, driver 581.95, CUDA 13.0 toolkit, host CPU
Intel i7-12700H (Alder Lake, no AVX-512 fused on retail parts; AVX2 +
FMA + F16C is the ISA ceiling). Reproduce script lives at
`tools/kaggle-issue81-cuda-ab.py` (Linux/Kaggle original); this run was
the Windows port driven from the handover prompt at
`handover-prompts/2026-05-10-a1000-cuda-ab-issue81.md`. Build flags
match `release.yml`'s `build-libs-windows-x86_64-cuda` slot exactly
(`-DGGML_CUDA=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF -DGGML_AVX2=ON
-DGGML_FMA=ON -DGGML_F16C=ON -DCRISPASR_BUILD_TESTS/EXAMPLES/SERVER=OFF`)
except `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86` (single-arch nvcc → ~5× faster
build, identical runtime). Raw JSON: `handover-prompts/a1000-pre-p0.json`,
`a1000-post-p0.json`, `a1000-onnx-p0.json`. Nsys kernel summaries:
`handover-prompts/nsys-crispasr-{pre,post}-kernsum.txt`. The original
prompt asked to also touch `tools/kaggle-issue81-cuda-ab.py`'s
top-of-file docstring; that file is currently *untracked* on `main`
(present locally only) so the docstring touch is left for whoever
lands the script properly — noted here per the prompt's "fix it in
PERFORMANCE.md and note the deviation" rule.

**PRE → POST verdict (Ampere sm_86, NPI active):** the flash-attn-ext
fusion **wins by 2.94×** on the long clip (9.605 → 3.267 s; p50
630 → 212 ms) and by **3.18×** on short (1.680 → 0.529 s). Bigger than
the M1 Metal win (1.61×) and the *opposite* sign from Kaggle T4
(sm_75) where POST ran 9 % slower. **Keep the fusion on for sm_80+
CUDA; gate it off for sm_75.**

**WDDM idle-clock confound — read this before reusing the numbers.**
The first pass of this bench, before any power-management tweak,
landed *very* differently: PRE 35.1 s long, POST 73.1 s long — POST
appearing **2.08× SLOWER** than PRE. Snapshotting `nvidia-smi` mid-bench
showed the GPU stuck at **P8 / 210 MHz / 4 W** with `clocks_event_reasons`
flagging `gpu_idle = Active` — the driver's heuristic doesn't see ggml's
hundreds-of-tiny-launches-per-chunk pattern as "sustained compute," so
on consumer/laptop SKUs it parks the GPU at idle clocks. ONNX CUDA EP
keeps the GPU at P0 because its launches are fewer, fatter, and cuDNN-
fused. TCC (Tesla Compute Cluster) mode that would bypass WDDM isn't
available on Quadro/RTX A workstation SKUs — only on Tesla / A100.
The fix that *actually* worked: nvidiaProfileInspector v2.4.0.31, run
once elevated:

```powershell
nvidiaProfileInspector.exe -setProfileSetting "_GLOBAL_DRIVER_PROFILE,0x1057EB71,1"
```

This sets NVAPI's `PreferredPState` to *Prefer maximum performance* (1)
in the global 3D profile — equivalently the entry the NV Control Panel
exposes as "Power management mode" / "Energieverwaltungsmodus" except
that on Quadro/RTX A SKUs the panel often hides this control entirely;
NPI reaches it via NVAPI directly. After the toggle, A1000 PRE wallclock
fell **3.66×** (35.1 → 9.6 s) and POST fell **22.4×** (73.1 → 3.27 s) —
i.e. the fusion's "regression" was *entirely* a WDDM idle-clock artifact.
The setting biases the heuristic upward; combined with ggml's launch
pattern, a few mid-bench dips to P5/270 MHz still happen, but the
average state is high enough that POST's per-launch overhead cost
disappears into the noise. **`nvidia-smi` confirmed P0 / 1140 MHz /
10 W idle right after the NPI call**; `nvidia-smi -lgc` would do the
same lock more aggressively but needs admin and isn't honoured on
consumer SKUs anyway. The `Adaptive` (default) state is what every
out-of-the-box Windows ggml-on-CUDA user is benchmarking; the
"Prefer maximum performance" state is what they should be benchmarking,
because real workloads on this stack will hit the same idle-clock
trap unless they do their own keepalive. (A keepalive helper script
that achieves the same effect without admin lives at
`bench-issue81/gpu_keepalive.py` — runs an ORT-CUDA tight loop in a
sidecar process, ~1 % GPU util, no extra setup beyond the existing
onnxruntime-gpu install.)

**Onnx fp32-vs-int8 on 4 GB VRAM:** fp32 wins overwhelmingly on the
long clip (1.537 s vs 21.226 s — int8 is **13.8× slower**). The cause
is visible in ORT's setup logs: `MemcpyTransformer: 742 Memcpy nodes
are added to the graph main_graph for CUDAExecutionProvider` for the
int8 encoder, vs only 2 nodes for fp32. ORT can't efficiently place the
int8 graph on this GPU (likely missing CUDA EP int8 op coverage for
some node types) and routes hundreds of ops back to CPU with H↔D copies
between each — pathological. The fp32 encoder fits cleanly on GPU
(2 Memcpys total) and runs at full tensor-core throughput. The 4 GB
VRAM didn't OOM — fp32 encoder uses ~2.7 GB peak. (Kaggle T4 with
16 GB VRAM showed the *opposite*: int8 was 10× slower than fp32 there
too — 9.06 s vs 0.87 s — so this isn't a VRAM artifact, it's an ORT
op-coverage issue with istupakov's int8 export. Worth flagging
upstream if not already.) **Practical takeaway for ONNX users on
parakeet: pick fp32; int8's quant savings are erased by ORT's H↔D
chatter.**

**Top-10 CUDA kernels by total GPU time (long clip, 3 runs at NPI-P0
state, nsys 2025.3.2 `cuda_gpu_kern_sum`):**

POST (post-fusion):

| kernel | total ms | % | calls |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mul_mat_q<q8_0, 64>` | 660 | 27 % | 11 773 |
| `im2col_kernel<float>` | 584 | 24 % | 310 |
| `cpy_scalar` | 151 | 6 % | 8 990 |

PRE (pre-fusion) diff:

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mul_mat_q<q8_0, 64>` | 553 | 25 % | 11 773 | -16 % time, same calls |
| `im2col_kernel<float>` | 530 | 24 % | 310 | -9 % time, same calls |
| `ampere_h16816gemm_128x64` | 65 | 3 % | 1 464 | -19 % time, same calls |
| **`soft_max_f32`** | **37** | **1 %** | **1 488** | **POST: ZERO** (folded into flash-attn) |
| **`ampere_sgemm_128x128_tn`** | **29** | **1 %** | **1 464** | **POST: ZERO** (folded into flash-attn) |
| `cutlass_80_tensorop_s1688gemm_64x64_16x6_tn` | 40 | 1 % | 2 952 | POST: 18 ms / 1 464 calls (-50 % both) |

The fusion's signature is exactly the disappearance of `soft_max_f32`
(1 488 launches, 37 ms) and `ampere_sgemm_128x128_tn` (1 464 launches,
29 ms) from POST: those are the explicit softmax + the relative-position
attention's separate fp32 sgemm in the unfused path. POST inlines both
into the cuBLAS-LT epilogue of `ampere_h16816gemm_128x64` (which grows
65 → 80 ms — absorbing some of the saved work — but the **kernel-launch
count drops by ~3 000 per 3-run bench**). Total nsys-tracked GPU compute
is roughly tied (PRE ≈ 2.2 s / 3 runs, POST ≈ 2.4 s / 3 runs); the
wallclock delta (28.8 → 9.8 s for 3 runs) is **driven almost entirely
by host-side launch overhead and WDDM idle-gap reduction**, not by GPU
compute itself getting faster. That's why the fusion looks small on
Linux/Kaggle (no WDDM = launch overhead is microseconds) and large on
Windows + Ampere consumer (WDDM = launch overhead is hundreds of µs
*and* the heuristic punishes long sequences of small launches with
clock drops). M1 Metal sits between because Metal's command-buffer
batching amortises some launch cost but not all.

**Remaining gap to onnx-fp32:** crispasr-post 3.27 s vs onnx-fp32
1.54 s on the long clip = **2.12× behind**, way down from the 6.5×
on Kaggle T4 and 4.6× on the issue reporter's RTX 4070. The closing
came from flash-attn-ext fusion eating most of the launch-overhead gap
on Ampere; what's left is the bigger picture:
1. **`im2col_kernel` + `mul_mat_q<q8_0,64>` together = 51 % of GPU
   time.** Fuse the conv2d-subsampling pass; it currently does an
   im2col+matmul split that ORT-fp32 sidesteps with a native conv op.
2. **`norm_f32` + `cpy_scalar` + `k_bin_bcast` = 16 % of GPU time** —
   classic ggml-elementwise overhead that CUDA Graphs would eliminate.
   Worth experimenting with ggml's existing `GGML_USE_CUDA_GRAPHS`
   support.
3. **`quantize_mmq_q8_1`** at 3 % is on-the-fly q8_1 quantisation of
   activations for q8_0 mat-mul; pre-quantising once per chunk would
   save it.

**Hardware-normalised cross-check vs the issue reporter's RTX 4070
Laptop (sm_89, ~15 TFLOPS fp32) and Kaggle T4 (sm_75, ~8 TFLOPS):**

| host | arch | TFLOPS fp32 | crispasr-post long mean | normalised to A1000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RTX A1000 Laptop (this run, NPI on) | sm_86 | ~5.0 | 3.27 s | 1.00× (baseline) |
| Kaggle T4 (Linux server) | sm_75 | ~8.1 | 6.15 s | 1.88× — POST regressed on Turing |
| RTX 4070 Laptop (issue reporter) | sm_89 | ~15.0 | 2.89 s | 0.88× — extrapolation only |

A1000 actually runs the long clip *faster* than T4 in absolute terms
on POST (3.27 s vs 6.15 s) **despite** having ~38 % less raw fp32
TFLOPS. That's the flash-attn-ext fusion winning on Ampere where it
couldn't on Turing. The 4070 number is the issue reporter's
DirectML/CUDA-EP measurement and not directly comparable, but the
A1000:4070 ratio (~1.13×) lines up with the TFLOPS gap minus a small
WDDM-idle-clock penalty A1000 still pays — i.e. the reporter's number
is what we'd expect; the 4070 isn't pathologically slow, it's just
that ONNX-fp32 on CUDA EP outpaces both.

**Arch-guard recommendation (one sentence):** *Keep flash-attn-ext on
for sm_80+ — A1000 (sm_86) confirms it generalises from M1 Metal
(1.6×) to Ampere (2.9× — the win is bigger on Ampere because tensor
cores swallow the fused gemms efficiently). For sm_75 (Turing)
specifically, the Kaggle T4 numbers say keep it off — there the fused
path's larger per-kernel work doesn't offset the launch reduction the
way it does on Ampere's tensor-core path.* Implementation note: this
is a runtime choice, not a build choice — guard the flash-attn-ext
dispatch on `compute_capability_major >= 8`, fall back to the unfused
path otherwise. Same arch threshold cuBLAS uses for its own
tensor-core paths, so it composes naturally with the rest of ggml's
sm-feature gating.

#### Closing the 2.12× gap to onnx-fp32 — what worked, what didn't

Took the A1000 baseline above (POST q8_0, 3.267 s long, 18.4× RT,
2.12× behind onnx-fp32) and ran a sweep of cheap optimization knobs
to see how close to ONNX-fp32 we can get without a kernel rewrite.

Findings, in order of surprise:

1. **`-DGGML_CUDA_GRAPHS=ON` is OFF by default** in ggml mainline
   (`GGML_CUDA_GRAPHS_DEFAULT OFF`, with a "(llama.cpp only)" hint in
   the option help) and was OFF in our `release.yml` Windows-CUDA build.
   Flipping it gives a **6.3 % wallclock win** on q8_0 (3.27 → 3.06 s)
   on this Ampere consumer SKU, with the runtime confirmation
   `ggml_backend_cuda_graph_compute: CUDA graph warmup complete`
   visible in the bench logs. The arch-gating in
   `ggml-cuda.cu:graph_check_compute_cap` already restricts capture to
   `cc >= GGML_CUDA_CC_AMPERE`, so flipping the default for shared-libs
   builds doesn't risk regressions on Turing. **Recommended follow-up
   PR:** flip the default in `release.yml`'s
   `build-libs-windows-x86_64-cuda` and the Linux equivalents — costs
   ~3 KB to ggml-cuda.dll, gains ~6 % on parakeet, no downside on
   Ampere+. Also worth flipping for examples/cli builds, as long as
   non-parakeet backends don't regress (would need a quick pass over
   whisper, fastconformer-ctc, firered-asr).

2. **F16 is *slower* than Q8_0 on A1000 Laptop**, both with and
   without graphs (3.52 s and 4.35 s vs 3.06 s for q8_0+graphs). I
   expected the opposite — Ampere tensor cores plus full-clock SM
   should win at F16. The reason: A1000 Laptop has only 192 GB/s
   memory bandwidth and 4 GB VRAM; F16 weights at 1.26 GB hit the
   bandwidth ceiling on every matmul, while Q8_0 at 745 MB stays cache-
   friendly. Combined with ggml's `mul_mat_q<q8_0>` MMQ path being
   hand-tuned for L1/L2 reuse (vs cuBLAS-LT's per-call handle overhead
   on F16), Q8_0 wins on this SKU. **Different SKUs probably differ:**
   on a 4070 Laptop with 256-bit memory and bigger caches, F16 likely
   wins; on Tesla-class with HBM, F16 wins decisively. So Q8_0 isn't
   universal — but on consumer-laptop Ampere, it is.

3. **CUDA Graphs *hurts* F16** (3.52 → 4.35 s, +24 % regression)
   despite helping Q8_0 (-6.3 %). The reason is visible in the F16
   path's reliance on cuBLAS-LT GEMM calls: ggml's CUDA Graphs path
   skips capture for ops that go through cuBLAS handles (those calls
   aren't recorded in the captured graph and become per-call cuBLAS-LT
   handle setups inside the graph-replay context — the worst of both
   worlds). q8_0 uses the native `mul_mat_q` MMQ kernels which capture
   cleanly into the graph. **Don't enable graphs unconditionally for
   F16 paths until ggml's CUDA Graphs handles cuBLAS-LT properly** — a
   known gap in ggml mainline.

4. **Q4_K is the worst quant on this hardware** (4.21 s long with
   graphs, 4.64 s without). K-quants use grouped quantisation with
   per-group scales and mins — a richer dequant scheme than Q8_0's
   per-block scale. The dequant cost outweighs the bandwidth saving
   on a workload where bandwidth wasn't the bottleneck. K-quants are
   a win on memory-pressured CPU inference; on a small dGPU with
   small weights, plain Q8_0 wins.

5. **Threads > 4 hurts** (t=12 +5.4 %, t=20 +20.5 %). The crispasr
   side has very little CPU work (mel extraction is the only sustained
   compute — ~5 % of wallclock). Adding threads adds OpenMP barrier
   sync without adding throughput. Default `--threads 4` is correct
   on this stack; bumping to match host core count isn't free.

**What's left to close the remaining 1.99× gap (without rewriting
ggml mainline):**

The kernel breakdown explains why GPU-only optimisations bottom out
near here. POST top-10 GPU kernel time = 1 987 ms across 3 long-clip
runs = ~662 ms/run. Wallclock per run = 3 063 ms (with graphs). So
GPU compute is **only 22 % of wallclock**; the other 78 % is host-
side work, sync points, and per-launch WDDM overhead that even CUDA
Graphs doesn't fully eliminate (it only captures the encoder graph
per chunk; cross-chunk transitions and the joint/decoder loop run as
discrete dispatches). Even if we made GPU compute zero, we'd still
be at ~2.4 s vs ONNX-fp32's 1.54 s — the **fundamental** gap is that
ONNX-fp32 routes 99 % of work through cuDNN+cuBLAS-LT-fused-conv +
tensor-core matmul, with only **2 H↔D Memcpy nodes** in the entire
graph rewrite (vs ggml's many Memcpy boundaries from per-op
back-and-forth between encoder-CUDA, joint-CPU, decoder-CUDA layers).

Three concrete follow-up PRs ranked by ROI for closing the rest:

a) **Flip `GGML_CUDA_GRAPHS=ON` as default for Windows-CUDA shared-libs
   builds** (this PR's evidence justifies it) — 6 % free, no risk on
   Ampere+. ~5 LOC change to `release.yml`. **Easiest win.**

b) **Replace ggml's `im2col + mul_mat` conv2d path with cuBLAS-LT
   matmul-with-conv prologue** for the FastConformer subsampling
   block. ~30 LOC in `ggml_cuda_op_conv_2d`. Should cut the 24 %
   im2col share by 2-3× and is the one place ggml mainline has not
   yet adopted cuBLAS-LT's prologue API. Expected: another ~10-15 %
   wallclock.

c) **Audit MMQ template-instance dispatch** for `mul_mat_q<q8_0,64>`
   — verify the `__nv_bfloat16` mma.sync variant in
   `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/template-instances/mmq-instance-q8_0.cu` is
   selected on sm_86 for our shapes (1024×T encoder matmuls). The
   non-tensor-core SIMT path is the current default; tensor-core
   variant should be ~2× on the dominant 660 ms kernel. Expected:
   another ~10 %.

Stacked, (a)+(b)+(c) plausibly land at ~2.4 s (RT 25×, 1.55× behind
onnx-fp32) — close enough that mel extraction and ctypes overhead
become the next bottleneck, not GPU kernels. To close the *last*
half-x requires either ggml mainline cuDNN integration (the
fundamental conv-kernel gap) or migrating parakeet to TensorRT EP
(an architectural pivot). Out of scope for this datapoint.

**Updated arch-guard / build-flag recommendation:** in addition to
the flash-attn-ext-on-sm_80+ verdict above, **flip
`GGML_CUDA_GRAPHS_DEFAULT` to `ON` in
`ggml/CMakeLists.txt`** for any shared-libs build targeting sm_80+.
The "llama.cpp only" hint in the help text is stale — parakeet (and
likely whisper, fastconformer-ctc, firered-asr) all benefit because
ggml-cuda's per-call graph instantiation is the bottleneck for any
chunked-streaming inference under WDDM, not anything llama.cpp-
specific. The arch gate inside `graph_check_compute_cap` already
prevents Turing/older from regressing.

#### Phase 0 / Phase 1 — root-causing the remaining 1.99× gap

Followed up the gap-closing addendum above with a directed nsys profile
of the best config (POST+CG q8_0 long) plus `GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=2` to
identify *exactly* where the remaining wallclock is going. Result: two
specific ggml-cuda support gates fall back to CPU for parakeet's
encoder graph, each producing 24 H↔D round-trips per chunk × 15 chunks
× 3 runs = 1 080 cross-backend transfers each = the bulk of the
4 197 H↔D transfers per long-clip run we saw in the first nsys round.

**Wallclock breakdown of crispasr-post+CG q8_0 long (3.063 s/run)
from `nsys stats cuda_api_sum`:**

| cost bucket | ms/run | % of wallclock | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cudaStreamSynchronize` | 808 | 26 % | host blocking for GPU; 8 723 calls/run |
| `cudaMemcpyAsync` (host API) | 339 | 11 % | 12 590 calls/run |
| actual H↔D GPU time | 190 | 6 % | 4 197 transfers/run (1 549 H2D + 2 648 D2H) |
| `cudaLaunchKernel` | 23 | 1 % | -12× from no-graphs (graphs work) |
| GPU kernel compute | ~660 | 22 % | from `cuda_gpu_kern_sum` |
| ~~remaining host~~ | ~1 050 | 34 % | Python, ctypes, mel-extract, sched-orchestration |

So **less than a quarter of wallclock is actual GPU compute** — the
fight is over the other 3/4. CUDA Graphs already reduced
`cudaLaunchKernel` from 269 ms to 23 ms but did NOT touch
`cudaMemcpyAsync` (graphs don't capture memcpy ops) — exactly the
"identical with graphs" line in the table.

**`GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=2` of the encoder graph (291 splits per chunk):**

| op falling to CPU | layers affected | trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **`GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_EXT`** | all 24 conformer layers | `ggml_cuda_get_best_fattn_kernel` rejects when `mask->ne[2] != 1`. Parakeet's relative-position-bias mask is **per-head** (n_heads=8, shape `(T_kv, T_q, 8, 1)`). This guard at `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn.cu:423` is the dominant CPU-fallback. |
| **`GGML_OP_UNARY`** (sigmoid on GLU gate) | all 24 conformer layers | `ggml-cuda.cu:4887` requires `ggml_is_contiguous(src)` for sigmoid; the GLU gate is a strided view of a `(2*d, T)` matmul output. The TODO comment one line earlier even says "should become: `ggml_is_contiguous_rows`" — i.e. the maintainers already know the check is too strict. |

Each op forces a 3-split pattern (entry copy + execute + exit copy)
in ggml-backend-sched, so 24 + 24 = 48 ops × 3 = 144 CPU splits per
chunk (the other 147 splits stay on CUDA). 144 × 15 chunks × 3 runs ≈
6 480 backend boundaries, each with at least one cudaMemcpyAsync and
one cudaStreamSynchronize — matches the API-time data above to within
noise.

**Phase 1 experiments tried (all regressed):**

1. **`op_offload=true` in `ggml_backend_sched_new`** (one-line change
   to `src/parakeet.cpp` flipping the 6th arg). Intent: tell sched to
   route host-buffer ops to a higher-priority backend (CUDA) when
   supported. Result: **+87 % regression** (3.063 → 5.727 s). Likely
   cause: re-evaluates weight placement every call, triggering
   per-chunk re-uploads of model weights. Reverted.

2. **`ggml_cont` before `ggml_sigmoid` in the GLU gate**
   (one-line change to `src/core/fastconformer.h:268-269`). Intent:
   force gate to be contiguous so ggml-cuda's UNARY gate accepts it,
   moving 24 sigmoid ops back onto CUDA. Result: **+60 % regression**
   (3.063 → 4.893 s). Likely cause: the extra `ggml_cont` node either
   broke CUDA Graphs capture for the convolution module sub-graph or
   forced fresh GPU allocations per chunk. Reverted.

The pattern is the same in both: client-side workarounds for ggml-cuda
support-gate gaps cost more than they save, because they perturb the
graph in ways CUDA Graphs and sched's allocator weren't tuned for.
**The real fixes belong inside ggml-cuda**, not in the model code.

**Concrete upstream-ggml PR targets, ranked by ROI:**

a) **Loosen `ggml_cuda_get_best_fattn_kernel`'s per-head mask check**
   (`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn.cu:423`). The current guard
   `if (mask && mask->ne[2] != 1) return BEST_FATTN_KERNEL_NONE;` rules
   out all transformer-XL / FastConformer style untied relative-
   position-bias attention. Either (i) the MMA-F16 / WMMA-F16 / TILE
   kernels already handle per-head masks and the guard is stale, or
   (ii) the kernels need a per-head `mask->nb[2]` stride load — a
   well-bounded kernel-loader edit. Expected impact on parakeet:
   ~15-25 % wallclock (removes 72 of the 144 CPU splits per chunk).

b) **Loosen `GGML_OP_UNARY`'s contiguity check** (`ggml-cuda.cu:4887`,
   `return ggml_is_contiguous(op->src[0]);`). The TODO comment one
   line above already proposes `ggml_is_contiguous_rows`. Most ggml-
   cuda unary kernels iterate by row and would work on strided-by-row
   inputs trivially. Expected impact: another ~10-15 % wallclock
   (the other 72 CPU splits).

c) **Capture `cudaMemcpyAsync` in CUDA Graphs**. ggml's current graph
   capture skips memcpy ops; for chunked-streaming inference this
   leaves the 339 ms/run of cudaMemcpyAsync API time uncaptured.
   Expected impact: ~10 % wallclock if the remaining memcpys can be
   folded into the per-chunk encoder graph.

Stacked, (a)+(b)+(c) plausibly close the long-clip gap from 3.063 s
to ~2.0 s (RT ~30×, ~1.30× behind onnx-fp32). The remaining
half-x to onnx-fp32 is the structural cuDNN-conv advantage discussed
in the previous addendum — that one really does need either cuDNN
integration in ggml mainline or a CUTLASS implicit-GEMM conv path.

**For now: 1.99× behind onnx-fp32 is the documented A1000 ceiling
with session-scope optimizations.** All three follow-up PRs are
upstream-ggml work; CrispASR can vendor any of the three as patches
once ggml mainline accepts them, but landing them in CrispASR alone
(without upstream review) risks breaking the dozen+ other ggml-using
models in this repo.
