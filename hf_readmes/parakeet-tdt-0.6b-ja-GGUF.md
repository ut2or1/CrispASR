# Parakeet TDT-CTC 0.6B (Japanese) — GGUF

GGUF / ggml conversions of [`nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-0.6b-ja`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-0.6b-ja) for use with the `crispasr` CLI from **[CrispStrobe/CrispASR](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR)**.

A 600 M-parameter Japanese ASR model with punctuation:

- **Hybrid FastConformer-TDT-CTC**: TDT (Token-and-Duration Transducer) decoder by default; the CTC head is included in these GGUFs and selectable at runtime with `--parakeet-decoder ctc`.
- **Built-in word-level timestamps** from the TDT duration head — no separate CTC alignment.
- **6.4 % CER on JSUT basic5000**.
- **CC-BY-4.0** licence.

## Files

All files include both the TDT decoder and the **CTC head** (added 2026-07;
earlier uploads lacked the CTC tensors, so `--parakeet-decoder ctc` silently
fell back to TDT).

| File | Size | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja.gguf`        | 1.25 GB | F16, **bit-exact match with NeMo on JSUT samples** |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja-q8_0.gguf`   | ~660 MB | Q8_0 — TDT output identical to F16 on our tests; recommended small file |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja-q4_k.gguf`   | ~476 MB | Q4_K — TDT decode degrades on this model (repetition loops); **use `--parakeet-decoder ctc`**, which is clean at Q4_K. See note below |

## Recommended: F16

Verified on a JSUT-basic5000 sample at F16:

```
NeMo (PyTorch): '水をマレーシアから買わなくてはならないのです。'
crispasr (F16): '水をマレーシアから買わなくてはならないのです。'
```

The F16 GGUF produces an **identical transcript** to the official NeMo Python pipeline.

### About the Q4_K variant

The Japanese model uses an **80-mel** preprocessor (vs. 128 for the
multilingual v3) and a smaller, more sensitive encoder distribution.
With our default Q4_K quantisation, two of the most logit-shaping
tensors (`joint.pred.weight`, `decoder.embed.weight`) fall back to
`q4_0` because their dimensions don't tile cleanly for q4_k blocks.
This is enough quantisation noise that the TDT decoder enters a
fixed-point loop after the first ~8 tokens. Two clean options:
prefer the **Q8_0** (TDT output identical to F16 in our tests), or
keep the Q4_K and decode with the **CTC head**
(`--parakeet-decoder ctc`) — CTC has no autoregressive feedback, so
the quantisation noise doesn't compound, and its output matches the
F16 CTC transcript.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build the runtime
git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR
cd CrispASR
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc) --target crispasr-lib

# 2. Download the F16
huggingface-cli download cstr/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja-GGUF \
    parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja.gguf --local-dir .

# 3. Transcribe a 16 kHz mono WAV
./build/bin/crispasr --backend parakeet \
    -m parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja.gguf -f your-japanese-audio.wav -t 8
```

You can also let crispasr auto-download the model:

```bash
./build/bin/crispasr --backend parakeet -m auto --auto-download \
    -f your-japanese-audio.wav --model-name parakeet-ja
```

## Long-form audio (v0.8.8+)

The encoder is numerically fragile past ~12 s of context on real speech —
single-pass decoding of long audio silently drops content (upstream NeMo
behaves the same on the same clips: its plain, local-attention, and
buffered long-form modes score 1–51 % content recall on our reference
clip). CrispASR ≥ `3a8141e3` handles this automatically: audio > 30 s is
VAD-segmented, slices are capped at 12 s (split at energy minima), each
slice decodes in one NeMo-exact pass, and a gap-fill second pass
re-transcribes any span the first pass left empty. Measured on the
issue #89 reporter's clips (phonetic char-bigram recall vs
whisper-large-v3-turbo): **97.2 %** (60 s), **96.9 %** (120 s), **95.9 %**
(300 s) — at the inter-model agreement ceiling (an independent
SenseVoice-small run scores the same recall on the same audio). No flags
needed; `--vad`, `--chunk-seconds N`, and `CRISPASR_PARAKEET_*` env vars
override the defaults (see the CrispASR CLI docs).

## Word-level timestamps for free

Pass `-v` to dump per-token timestamps from the TDT duration head. Each token spans one or more encoder frames; one frame = **80 ms**. No separate alignment model required.

## Model architecture

| Component | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Encoder       | 24-layer FastConformer, d=1024, 8 heads, head_dim=128, FFN=4096, conv kernel=9 |
| Encoder input | **xscaling = `True`** (input × √d_model = 32 before the first block) |
| Subsampling   | Conv2d dw_striding stack, 8× temporal (50 → 12.5 fps) |
| Predictor     | 2-layer LSTM, hidden 640, embed 3073 × 640 (blank padding-idx) |
| Joint head    | enc(1024 → 640) + pred(640 → 640) → ReLU → linear(640 → 3078) |
| Vocab         | 3072 SentencePiece tokens (Japanese, with punctuation) |
| Audio         | 16 kHz mono, **80 mel bins**, n_fft=512, hop=160, win=400 |
| Parameters    | ~600 M |

`xscaling=True` is the most important architectural detail vs. the
multilingual v3 model — `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` uses
`xscaling=False`. Both settings are stored in the GGUF metadata
(`parakeet.xscaling`) and read by the runtime, so the same code path
serves both variants without per-model branches.

## How this was made

1. The `.nemo` checkpoint is unpacked; every architecture hyperparameter
   (d_model, n_layers, ff_dim, pred_hidden, joint_hidden, xscaling, …)
   is read from `model_config.yaml` and cross-checked against the actual
   tensor shapes. The mel filterbank and Hann window are baked directly
   into the GGUF (`preprocessor.fb`, `preprocessor.window`).
2. NeMo state-dict keys are remapped to ggml-friendly names. Weights are
   written as F16 for matmul tensors and F32 for norms / biases / mel
   filterbank. A synthetic zero `conv.dw.bias` is added per encoder
   layer when the checkpoint omits it (older NeMo BN-only convs).
3. Inference is implemented in `src/parakeet.{h,cpp}`: the FastConformer
   encoder runs as a single ggml graph (BN folded into the depthwise
   conv weights at load time, xscaling applied between the pre-encode
   and the first block when `parakeet.xscaling=true`), the LSTM
   predictor and joint head run as manual F32 CPU loops, and the TDT
   greedy decode loop alternates "advance encoder frame" / "emit token +
   advance predictor" using the duration head's argmax.
