// crispasr_aligner.h — shared CTC / forced-alignment helper.
//
// LLM-based backends (qwen3, voxtral, voxtral4b, granite) emit plain text
// without per-word timestamps. A second pass through a CTC aligner
// produces frame-aligned word timings. Three model families are supported behind
// one entry point:
//
//   * canary-ctc-aligner   FastConformer + CTC head, 16k SentencePiece
//                          vocab covering 25+ European languages. The
//                          default; selected for any aligner model whose
//                          filename doesn't match the qwen3-fa pattern.
//
//   * qwen3-forced-aligner Qwen/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B. Same Qwen3-ASR
//                          architecture as the regular qwen3-asr backend
//                          but with a 5000-class lm_head that predicts
//                          per-token timestamps. Selected automatically
//                          when the aligner filename contains "forced-
//                          aligner" / "qwen3-fa" / "qwen3-forced".
//
//   * wav2vec2-aligner     Any GGUF accepted by the wav2vec2 backend
//                          (wav2vec2, HuBERT, data2vec CTC). Selected when
//                          the filename or GGUF architecture identifies that
//                          family. Uses the shared CTC Viterbi DP.
//
// Shared by the CLI, the C-ABI wrapper `crispasr_align_words_abi` in
// crispasr_c_api.cpp, and every language binding that reaches through
// that wrapper. `crispasr_word_aligned` is an in-library POD; the CLI
// adapts it to its own `crispasr_word` type.
