// core/asr_overlap_trim.h — drop the part of a chunk whose audio is already
// transcribed.
//
// Backends that decode long audio in OVERLAPPING chunks (canary's
// canary_transcribe_streamed: 8 s chunks, 2 s overlap) transcribe the overlap
// twice, once at the tail of chunk N and again at the head of chunk N+1. The
// second copy has to go.
//
// The usual tool is an LCS over the token ids: find the longest common
// subsequence between the tail of what has been accepted and the head of the
// new chunk, and drop the matched prefix. That works when the decoder emits the
// same words twice. It does nothing when the decoder emits DIFFERENT words for
// the same audio, and an attention decoder given a different amount of
// right-context routinely does exactly that (#365):
//
//   ... Ça c'est quand elle s'est rendue compte
//       qu'elle n'avait pas dormi.
//       J'arrive sur le...
//   ...      rendu compte qu'elle n'avait pas dormi.   <- same audio, re-worded
//
// No common subsequence worth the name, so nothing was dropped, and because the
// second chunk's tokens carry their own chunk offset the timestamps also ran
// BACKWARDS — 00:20:27,060 followed by 00:20:26,820.
//
// Time is the reliable signal here, because the overlap is a property of the
// chunking, not of what the decoder said. Anything ending at or before the last
// accepted token's end covers audio already spoken for, whatever words came out
// this time. This is deliberately a floor UNDER the LCS result rather than a
// replacement: LCS still catches re-emission that spills past the nominal
// overlap, and this catches the re-wording LCS cannot see.
//
// canary already applied exactly this rule to its WORD list and not to its
// token list, which is why word timings looked sane while the text and the SRT
// duplicated.
