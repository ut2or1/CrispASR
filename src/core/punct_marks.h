// core/punct_marks.h — "does this text already end in a sentence mark?"
//
// One implementation, because this predicate has now been written three times
// in two repos and the copies disagreed. CrispASR's crisp_punc carried it as an
// inlined test (issue #300, "never stack punctuation on punctuation");
// CrispEmbed's fireredpunc.cpp never got it and shipped a live defect where any
// already-punctuated input collected a second mark:
//
//   "ask not what your country can do for you."  ->  "...for you.."
//   "是的，我们需要更多时间。"                       ->  "...更多时间。。"
//   "does this already end in a question mark?"   ->  "...question mark??"
//
// For CrispASR that is an edge case (it punctuates its own ASR output, which
// arrives bare). For CrispEmbed it is the COMMON case: `--punct-model` is a
// post-processor over the user's OCR text, which usually IS already punctuated.
//
// ⚠ CROSS-REPO MIRROR. crisp_punc/src/fireredpunc.cpp lives in CrispASR but
// compiles against the CONSUMER's src/core, so this header must exist in both
// trees under the same name. Keep the copies in sync; the guard is
// tests/test_punct_marks.cpp (CrispEmbed) plus the sibling-crispasr CI job.
