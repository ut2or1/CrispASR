// crispasr_diarize.h — shared speaker diarization post-step.
//
// Assigns a speaker index to each ASR segment, operating on either the
// original stereo L/R PCM (for methods that use channel cues) or a mono
// buffer (for methods that use time or acoustic cues only).
//
// Four in-process methods live here — the same ones the CLI's
// `--diarize-method` surface offered before this file existed:
//
//   * Energy    — stereo only. Compares |L| vs |R| per segment; the
//                 louder channel wins. Matches the historical
//                 crispasr `(speaker 0/1)` labelling.
//   * Xcorr     — stereo only. TDOA on L/R via cross-correlation with
//                 ±5 ms search window; the sign of the peak lag picks
//                 the channel.
//   * VadTurns  — mono-friendly. Alternates 0/1 every time the gap
//                 between adjacent ASR segments exceeds 600 ms.
//   * Pyannote  — mono-friendly, ML-based. Runs the GGUF-packed
//                 pyannote segmentation net from src/pyannote_seg.*
//                 and maps the 7-class posteriors onto up to three
//                 speakers per segment.
//
// Sherpa-ONNX diarization via subprocess still lives in the CLI
// (examples/cli/crispasr_diarize_cli.cpp). It shells out to an
// externally installed sherpa binary, which is CLI-shaped UX policy
// rather than a library responsibility.
//
// Shared by: the CLI, the C-ABI wrapper `crispasr_diarize_segments` in
// crispasr_c_api.cpp, and every language binding that calls through
// that wrapper.
