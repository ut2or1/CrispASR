// crispasr_imatrix.h — importance-matrix (activation-statistics) collector.
//
// When the environment variable CRISPASR_IMATRIX_OUT is set to a file path,
// installing the collector on a ggml scheduler makes every ggml_mul_mat node
// whose src0 is a model weight accumulate the per-column sum-of-squares of its
// activation input (src1). At process exit the accumulated statistics are
// merged with any pre-existing file and written back, so a calibration corpus
// can be streamed across many CLI invocations that all point at the same
// output file.
//
// The resulting file is consumed by `crispasr-quantize --imatrix <file>`,
// which feeds the per-tensor importance vector to ggml_quantize_chunk so that
// k-quant / IQ-quant error is minimised on the weights the calibration data
// actually exercised (activation-weighted error instead of plain L2 — the same
// idea as llama.cpp's `llama-imatrix`).
//
// This is a no-op unless CRISPASR_IMATRIX_OUT is set; production paths are
// unaffected. Ported from CrispEmbed src/imatrix.cpp.
