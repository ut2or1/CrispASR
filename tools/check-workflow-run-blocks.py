Why this exists
---------------
Issue #339: all six Linux binary tarballs of v0.8.26 failed to build, and two
of the causes were plain shell mistakes sitting in `release.yml`:

  1. A literal `\\n` where a line continuation was meant:

         python3 scripts/check-bundled-deps.py release/... \\n   --allow '...'

     Inside a YAML `run: |` block those two characters reach bash verbatim.
     Bash reads `\\n` as an escaped `n`, so a stray positional argument `n`
     lands on the command — `error: unrecognized arguments: n`, exit 2. It hit
     four jobs (cuda, cuda13, hip, vulkan) and nothing caught it, because
     release.yml only ever executes on a tag push: the first time this shell
     runs is the release you were trying to cut.

  2. An assertion ordered before the step that satisfies it (not detectable
     here — that one needs a human reading the step).

`release.yml` is the least-tested code in the repo and the most expensive to
get wrong, so the cheap static checks belong in CI rather than in a tag push.
