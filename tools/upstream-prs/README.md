# Upstream PR drafts

Drafts of four ggml fork patches we would suggest upstream.
Redacted descriptions in own voice.

| # | Subject | Code provenance | Status |
| - | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | `ggml-cpu : avoid F16 saturation in MUL_MAT(F16, F32) on ARM NEON` | yours (5eef4e2 + the older conv-cast hunks) — bundles type-traits change with conv-graph kernel cast in one PR | drafted |
| 02 | `CUDA: handle OW > 65535 in im2col (2D and 3D)` | yours (1552434, re-applied in ca6c523) | ggml-org/ggml#1485 closed (wrong repo); refiled at [ggml-org/llama.cpp#22944](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/22944) 2026-05-11 |
| 03 | `CUDA: tile cpy_scalar_transpose along grid_y` | AI-authored (2639461) — re-derive yourself before sending | gated on llama.cpp#22944 merge |
| 04 | `metal : tighten input-position loop in kernel_conv_transpose_1d` | yours (4990da8) | ✅ merged [#1477](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/pull/1477) 2026-05-10 |
| 05 | `ggml-cuda : per-row-contiguous unary (Phase 1 UAR)` | WIP on branch `issue81-phase1-uar-wip` | drafted, not yet filed |
| 06 | `ggml-cuda : per-head mask in flash_attn_ext` | WIP on branch `issue81-phase1-uar-wip` | drafted, not yet filed |
| 07 | `metal : kernel_aa_snake_beta — fused AA SnakeBeta for BigVGAN v2` | drafted from upstream IndexTTS CUDA reference (Apache 2.0) — needs implementation | RFC scope only; new ggml op |

The `.patch` files are clean diffs; they are reference shape, not
literal `git am` payloads — line numbers are relative to our vendored
ggml master snapshot (fetched 2026-05-05) and may drift before you
open the PR.

`MASTER-AUDIT.md` records the cross-check against `ggml-org/ggml`
master (fetched 2026-05-05): all four still apply in shape; none
have been fixed upstream. Note: `im2col` gained a second target
site (`im2col_3d_kernel`) since v0.10.0; the PR 02 patch covers
both kernels.

## Which repo to file against

CUDA changes belong in **ggml-org/llama.cpp**, not ggml-org/ggml. ggml's
own README says "some of the development is currently happening in the
llama.cpp and whisper.cpp repos," and the `src/ggml-cuda/` commit log
on ggml master is 100% `(llama/NNNNN)` sync commits — i.e., CUDA work
flows llama.cpp → ggml, never the other way. Reviewers (slaren,
JohannesGaessler, …) live in llama.cpp's queue. Confirmed 2026-05-11
when @CISC closed-with-comment on #02 here and redirected us.

| Patch touches | File against | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/ggml-cuda/**` | **ggml-org/llama.cpp** | CUDA reviewers concentrate there; auto-syncs back |
| `src/ggml-metal/**` | ggml-org/ggml (direct) or llama.cpp | Both work; PR #1477 landed direct in ggml |
| `src/ggml-vulkan/**` | **ggml-org/llama.cpp** | same pattern as CUDA per commit log |
| `src/ggml-cpu/**`, `src/ggml.c`, type-traits | ggml-org/ggml | core lib stays in ggml |
| Standalone ggml examples / build | ggml-org/ggml | repo-local |

Title convention differs by repo:
- ggml-org/ggml: `<module> : <description>` (space around colon)
- ggml-org/llama.cpp: `CUDA: …` / `vulkan: …` (no space) — see recent master commits

llama.cpp also has a much stricter AI-content policy (AGENTS.md +
CONTRIBUTING.md): prohibits AI-written PR descriptions / commit
messages / reviewer responses, requires disclosure when AI
meaningfully contributed, threatens account bans for repeated
violations. Author your own prose; disclose mechanical AI assistance
explicitly in the Requirements section.

## Sending

Send sequentially, not concurrent (new-contributor cap = 1 open PR per
repo). Order — easiest reviewer call first:

1. ✅ **04** Metal perf → merged at ggml-org/ggml as [#1477](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/pull/1477) 2026-05-10
2. 📤 **02** CUDA im2col → filed at ggml-org/llama.cpp as [#22944](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/22944) 2026-05-11 (after ggml#1485 was redirected)
3. **03** CUDA cpy → file at ggml-org/llama.cpp after #22944 merges; re-derive the kernel-tiling code yourself first
4. **01** CPU F16 → file at ggml-org/ggml (touches ggml-cpu/ + ggml.c); design-discussion expected, consider opening an issue first

Per upstream:

- Squash-merge, title format per repo convention (see above)
- Run `test-backend-ops` against the touched op on at least two backends
- Run local CI from `ci/README.md` if practical

## Workflow

```bash
# pick the right repo per the table above; example for CUDA:
gh repo fork ggml-org/llama.cpp --clone --remote
cd llama.cpp
git checkout -b cuda-<short>              # e.g. cuda-im2col-ow
# apply your re-authored hunk to the file (don't `git am` the .patch
# directly; use it as reference)
git commit -m "CUDA: <description>"       # author your own message
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --web                        # author your own body; fill
                                          # the AI-usage disclosure
                                          # in Requirements honestly
```
