# verify-lib-bundle.sh — prove a packaged libcrispasr bundle actually LOADS.
#
# Usage: tools/verify-lib-bundle.sh <bundle-dir>
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# release.yml already gated on "every @rpath/DT_NEEDED dependency is present in
# the bundle". That check passed for v0.8.18 and the bundles were still broken
# for every consumer, because presence is not resolvability:
#
#   macOS: LC_RPATH was the CI runner's build tree
#          (/Users/runner/work/CrispASR/CrispASR/build-libs/ggml/src), which
#          exists nowhere else, so @rpath/libggml.0.dylib resolved to nothing.
#   Linux: DT_RUNPATH was '$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../../ggml/src' — one level too high,
#          pointing outside the bundle. Relative, so it leaked no CI path and
#          looked correct.
#
# Both shipped. The dependency really was in the tarball; the loader simply
# could not find it.
#
# TWO CLASSES OF DEPENDENCY. A GPU bundle (CUDA/HIP) legitimately depends on the
# host DRIVER — libcuda.so.1, libamdhip64.so — which is NEVER bundled and is
# provided at runtime on the user's machine. A plain dlopen in CI, where no GPU
# driver is installed, fails on libcuda and tells you nothing about whether the
# bundle's OWN libs resolve. So the authoritative gate here is a static
# rpath-CLOSURE check: for every library the bundle ships, every dependency
# whose soname is ALSO shipped in the bundle must be reachable via that library's
# rpath. That is exactly the v0.8.18 bug and it needs no driver. dlopen is then a
# best-effort confirmation that tolerates a missing external driver.
#
# Exits non-zero on a real failure, so it fails the RELEASE instead of the
# consumer.
