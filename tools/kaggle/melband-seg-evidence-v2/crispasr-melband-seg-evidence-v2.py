CrispASR — mel-band-roformer SEGMENTATION evidence, v2 (PR #422 review finding).

v2 of crispasr-melband-seg-evidence. The v1 pilot (chr1s4/crispasr-melband-seg-
evidence) established the method; this run fixes three things that made v1
structurally unable to deliver a trustworthy verdict. Everything through the
GGUF conversion is v1's scaffold unchanged.

WHY v1 COULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION
------------------------------------
1. ITS VERDICT GATE WAS AMBIGUOUS — the load-bearing flaw. v1 printed
   "METRIC IS BLIND" when |SDR(B)-SDR(C)| < 0.05 dB. But a null delta is
   equally consistent with "there was no boundary artefact to see", which is
   the RESULT you want, not a void run. Two opposite meanings, one output
   string. v2 never infers from a null: it MEASURES the boundary regions
   directly (see WITHIN-ARM below).

2. THE STIMULUS WAS DEGENERATE. v1 used samples/jfk.wav — solo speech through
   a VOCALS separator, where the model is near pass-through (PLAN.md records
   vocals rms 0.218 vs other rms 0.005, a 41x ratio on speech). Every arm then
   scores high and the very delta v1 was trying to read is compressed toward
   its own blind threshold. Instrumental music is degenerate in the mirror
   direction (vocals stem ~ silence). v2 uses real music WITH VOCALS so both
   stems are non-trivial.

3. ARM B HAD ONE INTERNAL BOUNDARY. At 11.000 s with the 8 s trained chunk
   (352800 samples, stride 264600) the loop yields exactly 2 segments and ONE
   crossfade, with the final segment 38% zero-pad. The arm validating the
   configuration users actually ship rested on a single boundary. v2 uses a
   20 s excerpt: 4 segments, 3 internal boundaries — 3x the evidence — while
   the reference stays unsegmented, which is the property the design rests on.
   Sizing from v1's own numbers: 11 s ~ 2.5 GB of a 16 GB card, and O(T^2)
   scaling puts 20 s at ~3.3x that (~8 GB), leaving ~50% headroom. 30 s does
   not fit; that ceiling is real and is why the clip is not longer.

THE WITHIN-ARM TEST (the reason v2 can conclude something v1 could not)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead of inferring segmentation quality from a cross-arm SDR delta, measure
it where it lives. Arm A (CRISPASR_MELBAND_NO_SEGMENT=1) is the same binary,
same weights, same graph path, differing from arm B ONLY in segmentation — so
A is the ideal local reference for isolating segmentation, better than torch
because it removes the port's own f32/graph differences as a confound. Then
for arm B vs A, compare SDR inside the overlap windows against SDR in the
segment interiors:

    boundary SDR ~= interior SDR   -> POSITIVE evidence of no overlap-add
                                      artefact; a real measurement, not a null
    boundary SDR <  interior SDR   -> the artefact, localised to the crossfades

This is immune to both of v1's ambiguities. It never compares across segment
lengths (so it cannot confuse "boundary density" with "3 s buffers driven
outside an 8 s-trained model"), and a clean result is positive evidence rather
than an unfalsifiable null.

The segment geometry is NOT assumed. The C++ prints
"segmented N samples into K chunks of L (stride S, overlap P%)"; v2 parses that
line and derives the windows from what actually ran, so a change to
resolve_segment_len cannot silently invalidate the analysis. The arm also
records WHICH branch fired (trained chunk_size from GGUF metadata vs the 8 s
fallback) so the middle arm is never assumed to be 352800.

ARMS

  ref        reference, unsegmented (torch)              <- absolute ground truth
  A no-seg   C++ CRISPASR_MELBAND_NO_SEGMENT=1           <- validates the PORT
  B default  C++ default = trained chunk from GGUF       <- THE SHIPPED PATH
  C seg=3    C++ CRISPASR_MELBAND_SEG_S=3                <- graded control

METHOD CONSTRAINTS (both from mistakes actually made in this repo)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Compare the int16 PCM PAYLOAD, never whole WAV files: the container's
  trailing C2PA/AI-disclosure chunk carries a TIMESTAMP and differs every run.
  A `cmp` over files once produced a confident wrong conclusion here.
* State the printed precision, and never report cosine alone: cosine saturates
  near 1 on audio and is scale-blind, so a real difference can render as "1".
  SDR and |est|/|ref| are printed alongside it at fixed width.
* SDR here is 10*log10(||ref||^2 / ||ref-est||^2) — signal-to-residual against
  the named reference, NOT BSS-Eval SDR with its projection step. Stated so the
  number is not silently compared against BSS-Eval figures elsewhere.

v1 also computed the torch reference in memory and never wrote it out, so it
could not be reused offline. v2 writes ref.wav into the kernel output.

STIMULUS: librosa's `fishin` example — Karissa Hobbs, "Let's Go Fishin'"
(ccMixter, Creative Commons). Vocals over acoustic accompaniment: verified
locally that ASR transcribes the sung lyrics from the chosen 20 s excerpt, so
the vocals stem is genuinely non-trivial. Fetched by librosa itself, so no
asset is vendored and no licence question is introduced.

Weights: KimberleyJSN/melbandroformer (MIT), converted IN THIS KERNEL for both
sides, so "do the two sides have the same weights" is not a variable.

# Arm A is the same binary, weights and graph path, differing ONLY in
# segmentation, so it isolates segmentation better than torch (no f32/graph
# confound). Comparing boundary windows against interiors WITHIN one arm is
# immune to v1's two ambiguities: it never compares across segment lengths, and
# a clean result is positive evidence rather than an unfalsifiable null.
# Thresholds, calibrated offline against synthetic arms before this ever ran on
# GPU (a tolerance wider than the defect is not a test). On a realistic signal
# where B differs from A by a small broadband amount: no crossfade artefact
# gives delta = +0.01 dB; 2x noise at the crossfades gives -3.01 dB; 10x gives
# -19.14 dB. So -1.0 dB sits well clear of the no-artefact case and well below
# the smallest injected defect. FLOOR_DB catches the bit-identical degenerate
# case described at the verdict below.
