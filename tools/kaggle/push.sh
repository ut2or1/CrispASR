# Push the CrispASR regression notebook to Kaggle.
#
# Kaggle's `kernels push` API uploads the contents of the given
# directory AND triggers an immediate run with the freshly-uploaded
# code. There is no "upload without running" flag — running is the
# implicit "this is now the current version" signal.
#
# After the first successful push, set up Kaggle's native weekly
# schedule via the kernel's "Settings → Schedule a notebook run"
# UI; the CLI doesn't expose scheduling. The script itself
# `git clone`s CrispASR at the start of every run, so as long as
# the local `tools/kaggle/crispasr-regression.py` we pushed is the
# bootstrap, Kaggle picks up `main` automatically each cycle.
#
# Re-push when the bootstrap script itself changes (env knob
# defaults, new pip deps). Pure C++ changes to CrispASR don't
# need a re-push — they get pulled at runtime.
