"""check-backend-wiring.py — audit that every backend is wired across the surface.

Generalises the manual cross-check done when adding a backend (docs/contributing.md
checklist). Uses `crispasr --list-backends-json` as the authoritative backend +
capability list, then verifies each backend is present everywhere it must be.

Two tiers:

  REQUIRED (exact string match on the CLI name; a miss is a real bug → exit 1):
    - CLI factory dispatch        examples/cli/crispasr_backend.cpp
    - c_api open/detect           src/crispasr_c_api.cpp
    - c_api available_backends    the `list += ",<name>"` line (the easy-to-miss one)
    - feature matrix              docs/feature-matrix.md (auto-generated; stale if missing)
    - cli.md beam list            only when the backend declares the beam-search cap

  ADVISORY (per *canonical* backend — one that owns a dedicated CLI adapter file;
  aliases and shared runtimes are skipped so they aren't false-flagged. A miss is a
  warning, not a failure):
    - README mention
    - a test file                 tests/test_<x>_live.cpp OR tests/test-<x>-params.cpp
    - a reference dumper          tools/reference_backends/<x>*.py (standalone OR registered)
    - an env-live-tests entry     tests/env-live-tests.sh
    - a registry entry            src/crispasr_model_registry.cpp
    - streaming.md row            only when the backend declares the streaming cap

The Go cgo LDFLAGS check is delegated to the existing authoritative tool
(`tools/sync_go_cgo_ldflags.py --check`), which CI also runs.

Usage:
    python tools/check-backend-wiring.py [--crispasr ./build/bin/crispasr] [--verbose]

Exit code: 0 if all REQUIRED checks pass, 1 otherwise (advisory gaps never fail).

    # CMake, exactly as it looked in the CMakeLists -- but nothing in
    # crispasr_c_api.cpp referenced its symbols, so the linker dropped the
    # whole object from the shared library. It was not merely unreachable from
    # the session API: it was NOT PRESENT IN THE SHIPPED .dylib AT ALL, while
    # the CLI worked because crispasr-cli links the static lib directly.
    # Confirmed against the released v0.8.17 artifact, where
    # mel_band_roformer_separate is absent.

    # Symbol presence is ground truth, so this has no alias false positives --
    # unlike name-matching, which produced 21/76 noise. Demangling matters:
    # some runtimes are C++-linkage, so `sidon_init_from_file` appears only as
    # `__Z20sidon_init_from_file...` and a raw grep misses it.
