# package-lib-bundle.sh — make a libcrispasr bundle loadable and ergonomic.
#
# Usage: tools/package-lib-bundle.sh <bundle-dir>
#
# Run after the job has copied libs into <bundle>/src and <bundle>/ggml/src.
# Does three things, in order:
#
#   1. FLATTEN   every library into <bundle>/lib, leaving <bundle>/src and
#                <bundle>/ggml/src as symlinks so existing consumers still work.
#   2. RPATH     rewrite to loader-relative so the bundle resolves wherever it
#                is extracted (@loader_path on macOS, $ORIGIN on Linux).
#   3. VERIFY    delegate to verify-lib-bundle.sh, which relocates and dlopens.
#
# WHY FLATTEN. Downstream app bundles (Flutter/Xcode Frameworks, Android
# jniLibs, a Rust target dir) want one directory of libraries. Splitting them
# across src/ and ggml/src makes every consumer write a copy loop first.
# crispasr-sys/build.rs already probes BOTH <dir>/src/lib* and <dir>/lib*, so a
# flat dir is something it can consume today.
#
# WHY SYMLINKS RATHER THAN MOVING. release.yml has long told consumers to point
# CRISPASR_SYS_LIB_DIR at the extract dir, which resolves via <dir>/src/. Moving
# the files would break that silently. Real files live in lib/; src/ and
# ggml/src/ become symlinks to it, so both spellings work and nothing is
# duplicated.
#
# WHY RPATH IS NOT OPTIONAL. v0.8.18 shipped bundles that could not be loaded at
# all: macOS baked the CI runner's build tree into LC_RPATH, and Linux used
# $ORIGIN/../../ggml/src — one level too high, pointing outside the bundle. Both
# passed the old packaging gate because it only checked that dependencies were
# PRESENT. Presence is not resolvability.
