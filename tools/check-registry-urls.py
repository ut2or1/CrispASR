"""Verify every model-registry URL actually resolves.

The backend-wiring audit checks that a registry ROW EXISTS. It cannot check that
the row points at anything real, and nothing else did either — so a registry
entry naming a HuggingFace repo that had never been created shipped to main and
`-m auto` would have 404'd for that backend (tabcnn, 2026-07-20). The failure is
invisible until a user tries to download.

This closes that gap: parse `src/crispasr_model_registry.cpp`, HEAD every URL,
report anything that does not resolve.

    python tools/check-registry-urls.py                 # all entries
    python tools/check-registry-urls.py --backend tabcnn
    python tools/check-registry-urls.py --timeout 20 --jobs 8

Exit 1 if any URL fails. Network-dependent, so this is NOT a unit test — run it
before a release, or on a schedule like the readme-langs lint job.

Deliberately uses HEAD with redirects followed. HuggingFace `resolve/main/...`
URLs 302 to a CDN, so a naive no-redirect check reports 302 for healthy files
and 404 only for genuinely missing ones.
