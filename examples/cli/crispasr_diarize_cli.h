// crispasr_diarize_cli.h — CLI-side diarization shim.
//
// The four in-process diarization methods (energy, xcorr, vad-turns,
// pyannote-native) live in `src/crispasr_diarize.h` so every CrispASR
// consumer reaches them through the shared library. This CLI-local
// header keeps the subprocess-based sherpa-onnx method plus the
// `--diarize-method` → method-enum translation that CLI callers rely
// on.
//
// CLI callers: use `crispasr_apply_diarize(..., whisper_params &)`.
// Library callers / wrappers: use
// `crispasr_diarize_segments(..., CrispasrDiarizeOptions &)` from
// `src/crispasr_diarize.h` directly.
