# PORTABLE variant (#261). Same CUDA GPU build as main-cuda, but the CPU ggml
# backend is compiled for the GENERIC x86-64 baseline (SSE2 only) — every
# optional ISA is explicitly OFF. The point: `ggml_cpu_init()` in the stock
# main-cuda image emits a BMI2 instruction (see below), so the server SIGILLs
# at STARTUP on any pre-Haswell CPU — during ordinary model load, before any
# request, and even for pure GPU ASR (each backend also creates a CPU backend
# for auxiliary ops). The self-check + soft-degrade in main-cuda can only
# refuse vad/diarize once the server is up; it cannot survive a startup crash.
# This image lowers the CPU baseline so the process starts and runs on ancient
# CPUs — the RTX GPU still carries the ASR; CPU VAD/diarization run on the
# generic (slower but correct) kernels.
#
# ⚠ Why every flag must be spelled OFF: GGML_NATIVE=OFF does NOT mean baseline.
# ggml's CMake:
#     if (GGML_NATIVE OR NOT GGML_NATIVE_DEFAULT)  set(INS_ENB OFF)
#     else()                                       set(INS_ENB ON)
#     option(GGML_BMI2 "..." ${INS_ENB})   # and GGML_SSE42 / GGML_AVX
# GGML_NATIVE_DEFAULT is ON for a normal build, so GGML_NATIVE=OFF lands in the
# else branch → INS_ENB=ON → BMI2/SSE42/AVX default ON and ggml-cpu gets
# `-mbmi2`. Forcing each to OFF is the only way to get a true SSE2 baseline.

# The real second half of the #31 fix.
#
# nvidia/cuda:*-runtime-* installs `cuda-compat-<ver>` which drops
# /etc/ld.so.conf.d/000_cuda_compat.conf pointing at /usr/local/cuda/compat.
# That dir is processed first by ldconfig (the `000_` prefix is deliberate),
# so the cache resolves libcuda.so.1 → the compat copy that ships with the
# image. When the nvidia container runtime later mounts the host's libcuda
# at --gpus startup, the cache entry is *still* the compat one if we don't
# rebuild ldconfig. The compat libcuda is older than the host kernel
# driver on R580+ hosts → 'unsupported display driver / cuda driver
# combination' (#31, even after the LD_LIBRARY_PATH-only fix in 7587ad2).
#
# Removing the .conf entry and rerunning ldconfig means the cache is
# *empty* of libcuda at image build time. nvidia-container-runtime then
# adds the host libcuda when --gpus is passed and runs ldconfig again,
# which is exactly the flow that works on the bare nvidia/cuda image.
#
# Compat libs stay on disk at /usr/local/cuda/compat/. Users with old host
# drivers can still opt back in at runtime via:
#   docker run -e CRISPASR_USE_CUDA_COMPAT=1 ...
# which run-server.sh honours by prepending the dir to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
