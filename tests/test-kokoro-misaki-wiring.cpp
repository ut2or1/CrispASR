// test-kokoro-misaki-wiring.cpp — #316: does the misaki G2P the PRODUCT calls
// actually apply misaki's rules?
//
// This test exists because the answer was no for a whole release. The
// contextual function-word rules, the capitalisation-stress rule and the
// phrase-final lexicon all shipped in 0.8.24/0.8.25 behind
// `g2p_en::context::context_words`, which nothing anywhere set — so
// `phonemize_misaki_en` read "the" as `ði` in every position and the article
// "a" as the LETTER, `ˈA` with primary stress. Every unit test passed: they
// called `core_g2p_ctxwords::lookup` directly, which is not the code path the
// product uses.
//
// So this one goes through `crispasr::phonemize_misaki_en` — the function
// kokoro.cpp calls — with a tiny lexicon in misaki's own JSON shape pointed at
// by CRISPASR_MISAKI_DICT_PATH. Hermetic: no download, no model, no audio.
