// #365 — canary duplicated phrases and ran its timestamps backwards.
//
// canary_transcribe_streamed decodes long audio in overlapping chunks (8 s
// chunk, 2 s overlap) and deduped the seam with an LCS over token ids. An LCS
// compares what the decoder SAID, so it only works when the decoder says the
// same thing twice. Given a different amount of right-context an attention
// decoder routinely re-words the overlap instead, and then the LCS matches
// nothing, the whole re-transcription is appended, and the timestamps run
// backwards because the new chunk's tokens carry their own chunk offset:
//
//   00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,340  J'arrive sur le...
//   00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,020  rendu compte qu'elle n'avait pas dormi.
//
// Time is the signal that survives re-wording: the overlap is a property of the
// chunking, not of the words. Anything ending at or before the last accepted
// token's end is audio already spoken for.
