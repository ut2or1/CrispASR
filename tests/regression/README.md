# Per-backend regression tests

These tests guard against silent behavioural regressions by running
each registered backend's GGUF under test against:

1. A **pinned expected transcript** — byte-for-byte match against a
   string captured at a known-good commit. Catches greedy-decode
   divergences (e.g. issue #88), tokenizer changes, sample-rate
   handling drift.
2. The **per-stage diff harness** — cosine similarity of every
   diff-tested stage (encoder output, mel, intermediate captures)
   against a pre-computed Python-reference dump. Catches numerical
   regressions even when the transcript happens to land on the same
   string.

## Why pin everything

Two failure modes the regression infra protects against:

1. **HF upstream re-quantise.** A maintainer re-runs the quantiser
   on the source weights and pushes a new GGUF to the same repo
   path. Users who download fresh suddenly get a different file;
   the regression test silently changes verdict. **Fix:** each
   GGUF entry pins an HF revision SHA in `manifest.json`. The CI
   downloads exactly that revision.
2. **Reference-dump drift.** Re-running `tools/dump_reference.py`
   on a newer NeMo / transformers / torch can produce slightly
   different numbers (FP order-of-summation, casting heuristics).
   **Fix:** reference dumps live in `cstr/crispasr-regression-fixtures`,
   pinned to a specific revision in `manifest.json`'s `fixtures`
   block.

This was prompted by the ggml-assertion-hardening incident
(see LEARNINGS.md / issue history) where a silent upstream behaviour
change cascaded into user-visible regressions.

## Layout

```
tests/regression/
├── manifest.json    # per-backend pins: GGUF revision + fixture path + expected transcript + cos thresholds
├── run_one.py       # driver: downloads pinned GGUF + ref, runs crispasr + crispasr-diff, asserts
└── README.md
```

Sample WAVs live in `samples/` (already in-repo).

The reference-dump archives (`ref.gguf` containing encoder_output +
mel_spectrogram + per-layer captures) live in the HuggingFace repo
[`cstr/crispasr-regression-fixtures`](https://huggingface.co/cstr/crispasr-regression-fixtures)
under `<backend>/<sample-stem>/ref.gguf`.

## Running locally

Build first:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-ninja-compile \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCRISPASR_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build-ninja-compile --target crispasr crispasr-diff
```

Run one backend:

```bash
BUILD_DIR=build-ninja-compile tests/regression/run_one.py parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja
```

Run all backends:

```bash
BUILD_DIR=build-ninja-compile \
  jq -r '.backends[].name' tests/regression/manifest.json | \
  xargs -I{} tests/regression/run_one.py {}
```

Env knobs (see `run_one.py` docstring for the full list):

- `WORK_DIR` — staging directory for HF downloads. Default: a
  tempdir, cleaned on exit. Set to a persistent path on
  `/Volumes/backups/...` to avoid re-downloading between runs.
- `KEEP_WORK=1` — keep the staging dir for debugging.
- `CRISPASR_BIN` / `DIFF_BIN` — override binary paths entirely.

## CI

`.github/workflows/regression.yml` runs nightly at 04:00 UTC
(`workflow_dispatch` also available). The matrix builds the CLI +
diff binary once per backend, downloads pinned artifacts from HF,
asserts both transcript and diff thresholds, and frees disk before
exiting. Each backend is its own matrix entry with
`fail-fast: false` so one bad backend doesn't mask the rest.

## Adding a new backend

1. **Dump the reference** on a known-good commit:

   ```bash
   HF_HOME=/Volumes/backups/ai/huggingface-hub \
   TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 \
   python tools/dump_reference.py \
     --backend <name> \
     --model-dir <hf-id-or-local-path> \
     --audio samples/<sample>.wav \
     --output /Volumes/backups/ai/crispasr-regression/<backend>/<sample-stem>/ref.gguf
   ```

   `--backend <name>` must match an entry in
   `tools/dump_reference.py`'s `REGISTERED_BACKENDS`. The dump captures
   whatever stages the reference module declares (see
   `tools/reference_backends/<backend>.py`).

2. **Run crispasr** on the same `(GGUF, sample)` pair, manually
   sanity-check the transcript, and lock that string as the
   expected.

3. **Run crispasr-diff** and read the cos_min values for each
   stage. Set the per-stage threshold in `manifest.json` to the
   measured cos_min minus a small safety margin (`0.001` is
   reasonable for `cos_min ≥ 0.999`; looser for known-divergent
   stages like mel preprocessing).

4. **Upload the ref.gguf** to `cstr/crispasr-regression-fixtures`
   under `<backend>/<sample-stem>/ref.gguf`. Use
   `hf upload-large-folder` for resumable uploads (see
   `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for the playbook). Capture the resulting
   commit SHA and update `fixtures.revision` in `manifest.json`.

5. **Look up the GGUF revision SHA** for the model under test:

   ```bash
   curl -s "https://huggingface.co/api/models/<repo>" | \
     python -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['sha'])"
   ```

   Put it in the backend's `gguf.revision` field.

6. **Verify locally** with `tests/regression/run_one.py <name>` —
   should pass at the current commit. Commit `manifest.json` (and
   any new sample WAV in `samples/`) on the same branch.
