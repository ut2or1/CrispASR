"""Run one backend's regression against pinned HF artifacts.

For each backend in ``tests/regression/manifest.json``:

1. Download the GGUF under test at the pinned HF revision SHA.
2. Download the reference-dump archive at the pinned fixtures revision.
3. Run ``crispasr -m <gguf> -f <sample>`` and assert the transcript
   matches the pinned ``expected_transcript`` byte-for-byte.
4. Run ``crispasr-diff <backend_id> <gguf> <ref> <sample>`` and assert
   every stage's ``cos_min`` is at or above its pinned threshold.

Backends with ``"skip_diff": true`` in the manifest skip steps 2 and 4
(transcript-only check). This lets lightweight backends join the GH
Actions nightly matrix before their Kaggle-baked reference dumps are
ready. The GGUF + sample are still downloaded at pinned revisions so
upstream re-quantise is caught.

Pinned revisions guard against:

- Upstream re-quantise of the GGUF on HF silently changing what users
  download (the regression-from-ggml-assertion-hardening lesson).
- Drift in our own reference dumps between commits.

Exit code is the number of failures (0 on full success).

Usage:

  tests/regression/run_one.py parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja
  BUILD_DIR=build-ninja-compile tests/regression/run_one.py parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja
  CRISPASR_BIN=/path/crispasr DIFF_BIN=/path/crispasr-diff \\
    tests/regression/run_one.py parakeet-tdt-0.6b-ja

  # Dry-run: HEAD-check every pinned HF object referenced by the
  # manifest (or just the named backend). No downloads, no binary
  # needed. ~1 s for the seed manifest. Use as a fast PR-time gate.
  tests/regression/run_one.py --dry-run

Env:

  BUILD_DIR       Build directory containing bin/crispasr + bin/crispasr-diff

  CRISPASR_BIN    Override the crispasr binary path entirely.
  DIFF_BIN        Override the crispasr-diff binary path entirely.
  WORK_DIR        Where to stage downloads (default: a tempdir; cleaned on
                  exit unless KEEP_WORK=1).
  KEEP_WORK       If set to 1, don't delete WORK_DIR on exit.
  REGRESSION_MANIFEST  Path to manifest.json (default:
                  tests/regression/manifest.json).
