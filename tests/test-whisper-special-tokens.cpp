// test-whisper-special-tokens.cpp — serialized-vs-legacy special-token layout (#322).
//
// Nothing pinned this before. Whisper is absent from tests/regression/manifest.json
// (45 backends, none of them whisper) and no test anywhere asserted a token id, so
// the loader resolving `token_eot` to the wrong value was invisible to CI — and
// would have been invisible again after the fix.
//
// The bug: the old probe was `set_token_id(vocab.token_eot, "<|endoftext|>") &&
// set_token_id(vocab.token_sot, "<|startoftranscript|>")`. `set_token_id()` ASSIGNS
// its destination and then returns true, and it sat on the left of a short-circuit
// `&&` — so a vocab carrying `<|endoftext|>` but not `<|startoftranscript|>` came out
// with the flag correctly false and `token_eot` already overwritten. The legacy
// fixup (`token_eot++`) then incremented an id that was already resolved.
//
// The ids below are REAL, measured across eight whisper `.bin` files and
// openai/whisper-tiny's vocab.json — not invented for the test.
