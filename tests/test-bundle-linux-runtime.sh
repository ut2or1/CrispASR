# test-bundle-linux-runtime.sh — regression test for scripts/bundle-linux-runtime.sh.
#
# The bug this pins down shipped twice before anyone could see it, because the
# packaging scripts only ever ran inside a release job: `bundle-linux-runtime.sh`
# rewrote RUNPATH to $ORIGIN *before* asking `ldd` what the binaries needed, so
# any dependency reachable only through the binary's own RUNPATH became
# `=> not found` and was quietly filtered out with the blank lines. On the HIP
# leg that was `libomp.so` (ROCm's clang links OpenMP against LLVM's, which
# lives in /opt/rocm/lib/llvm/lib); the tarball failed to package at all, and
# only because check-bundled-deps.py happened to be downstream.
#
# Nothing here needs ROCm, or a GPU, or a release. A private directory plus
# -Wl,-rpath reproduces the exact condition: a library the loader can find only
# via the RUNPATH the bundler is about to erase.
#
# Skips (exit 77) anywhere the tools are missing, so it is inert on macOS.
