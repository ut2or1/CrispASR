# CrispASR #341. The published libcrispasr-linux-x86_64-hip bundle had
# `libomp.so` in DT_NEEDED and did not carry it: ROCm clang's OpenMP runtime,
# which lives in /opt/rocm/lib/llvm/lib and is on no loader search path. Nothing
# caught it, because `verify-lib-bundle.sh` gates INTRA-bundle resolvability —
# for every library the bundle ships, every dependency whose soname is ALSO
# shipped must be reachable via rpath — and a dependency absent from the bundle
# entirely is outside the question it asks.
#
# So this checks the other half: an external dependency reachable only through
# the build-time RUNPATH must end up in the bundle, and the bundle must still
# load once that directory is gone. Needs no GPU and no release.
#
# Skips (exit 77) anywhere the tools are missing, so it is inert on macOS —
# the packaging script's macOS branch is deliberately not changed by #341.
