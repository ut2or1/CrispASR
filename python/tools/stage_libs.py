"""Stage a prebuilt libcrispasr bundle into the `crispasr` package for wheel
building.

The release workflow (`release.yml`) already builds relocatable
`libcrispasr-<platform>[-cuda|-vulkan].tar.gz` bundles whose libraries have
their rpaths rewritten to `$ORIGIN` / `@loader_path` (see
`tools/package-lib-bundle.sh`). This script copies those libraries next to
`crispasr/_binding.py` — where `_find_lib()` probes first — and best-effort
compiles the tiny `_helpers.c` shim, so that `python -m build` produces a
self-contained platform wheel.

Usage:
    python tools/stage_libs.py --bundle <extracted-bundle-dir> [--pkg crispasr]

Symlinks are materialised as real files: the wheel (a zip) cannot be relied on
to preserve symlinks across pip versions, and soname-based inter-library
resolution needs the versioned file to exist as real bytes.

    everything that is not core-libc, and repoint each copy's RUNPATH at

    loader uses each library's OWN RUNPATH, not the one that pulled it in — the
    easy thing to get wrong here).
